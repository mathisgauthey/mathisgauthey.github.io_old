[{"content":"How I Reverse Engineered Daylio Backup to Allow for Csv File Importing Introduction On May 1st 2023, I decided to use Obsidian as my all-in-one organisation app. It used to allow me to :\nDo my journaling (formerly Daylio) Manage my GTD setup for tasks and projects (formerly Todoist) Do some daily planning along with periodic reviews and goals (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly) Log my workouts Take notes alongside tasks, and manage my knowledge But I recently came to the conclusion that Obsidian is not cheap, and according to the Unix philosophy :\nMake each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new \u0026ldquo;features\u0026rdquo;.\nWell, I use Obsidian for saving articles and files, taking notes from these resources, and sharing them on my website. It\u0026rsquo;s all about knowledge, and it should stay this way.\nI moved my workflow to respective software :\nWorkout logging ⇒ Hevy GTD and planning ⇒ TickTick and Google Calendar Journaling ⇒ Daylio Daylio was set to make a come back, but how could I transfert my data back ? Well, as there is no officially supported way to import data to Daylio, I needed to find one.\nI remember I used to export my Daylio to csv and use Obsidian-Daylio-Parser to import them to Obsidian. Maybe I can take the other route ?\nExporting My Journal Entries From Obsidian The Idea My journaling workflow was simple on Obsidian.\nI took note on my daily note (YYYY-MM-DD.md) in the ## Journal 📔 section. The section naming evolved, but always had the Journal keyword.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s a start. I used to query my daily notes journal entries using this dataviewjs script :\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 const header = \u0026#39;#+ [^\\n]*?Journal[^\\n]*?\u0026#39; // You can update this to filter as you like - filtering for just your daily notes would be good const pages = dv.pages(\u0026#39;\u0026#34;-Daily-Notes\u0026#34;\u0026#39;).filter(page =\u0026gt; page.file.name.includes(\u0026#34;2024\u0026#34;)).sort(x =\u0026gt; x.file.name, \u0026#39;desc\u0026#39;) // This regex will return text from the Summary header, until it reaches // the next header, a horizontal line, or the end of the file const regex = new RegExp(`\\n${header}\\r?\\n(.*?)(\\n#+ |\\n---|$)`, \u0026#39;s\u0026#39;) for (const page of pages) { const file = app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(page.file.path) // Read the file contents const contents = await app.vault.read(file) // Extract the summary via regex const summary = contents.match(regex) if (summary) { // Output the header and summary dv.header(2, \u0026#34;[[\u0026#34;+file.basename+\u0026#34;]]\u0026#34;) dv.paragraph(summary[1].trim()) } } Basically, I search for files in my -Daily-Notes folder, sort them, look for the journal section and take the notes inside with a clickable filename.\nBut I also had some heatmap-calendar script to query moods :\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 dv.span(\u0026#34;Journal Mood 📈\u0026#34;) const calendarData = { year: 2024, // (optional) defaults to current year colors: { // (optional) defaults to green scale: [\u0026#34;#f2120d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#ef7626\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#faed03\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#0af508\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#051ac3\u0026#34;] }, showCurrentDayBorder: true, // (optional) defaults to true defaultEntryIntensity: 4, // (optional) defaults to 4 intensityScaleStart: 1, // (optional) defaults to lowest value passed to entries.intensity intensityScaleEnd: 5, // (optional) defaults to highest value passed to entries.intensity entries: [], // (required) populated in the DataviewJS loop below } //DataviewJS loop for (let page of dv.pages(\u0026#39;\u0026#34;-Daily-Notes\u0026#34;\u0026#39;).where(p =\u0026gt; p.mood)) { //dv.span(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026#34; + page.file.name) // uncomment for troubleshooting calendarData.entries.push({ date: page.file.name, // (required) Format YYYY-MM-DD intensity: page.mood, // (required) the data you want to track, will map color intensities automatically content: await dv.span(`[](${page.file.name})`), // (optional) Add text to the date cell color: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, // (optional) Reference from *calendarData.colors*. If no color is supplied; colors[0] is used }) } renderHeatmapCalendar(this.container, calendarData) And finally, some sort of title on journal entries inspired from reddit : An Interesting Title : TITLE.\nI need to be able parse all that to Daylio. Let\u0026rsquo;s recap.\nThe Goals (based on the Csv Export of Daylio) Take the date from the filename, add an arbitrary time and create an epoch timestamp. Query the entire Journal section of each daily-note. Take the mood::x key and add it as a daily evaluation from 1 to 5 for Daylio moods. And remove that part afterward. Take the title for the new Daylio note title. And remove that part afterward.

They are a pain. I won\u0026rsquo;t explain much because ChatGPT exists, and you can use regex101 to build, test, and debug regex. Importing Data to Daylio Well, at first I thought I could import from CSV just like I exported as CSV. Nope. And support told me no as well, it\u0026rsquo;s related to their take on privacy policies.\nSo… I searched the internet and found two interesting links (that you can take a look at, if you go further down this article). I needed to reverse engineer the Daylio backup file.\nExplanation Basically :\nA Daylio backup is a file like that : backup_DATE.daylio. Actually, it\u0026rsquo;s a zip file. So you can use 7zip to open it. You then found yourself with a backup.daylio file which is just a base64 encoded json, and an assets folder for pictures. Copy the backup.daylio file out of the archive. You need to use a tool to decode the base64 file. Then you can lint it so that it become easier to modify. I then created a script to convert my CSV file from above to some json entries that I\u0026rsquo;ll paste inside the \u0026quot;dayEntries\u0026quot;: [] part of the json file. You can also edit the \u0026quot;metadata\u0026quot; \u0026gt; \u0026quot;number_of_entries\u0026quot; key as well, even thought it changed nothing appart from the detected amount of notes when using Daylio import functionality. You then need to use another tool to compress the json. Finally, you encore it back and replace the old one in the .daylio archive. Go to Daylio \u0026gt; More \u0026gt; Backup \u0026amp; Restore \u0026gt; Advanced Options \u0026gt; Import and select your backup zip file backup_DATE.daylio that you previously modified by changing the backup.daylio file inside. The Script Nothing too hard here, just some csv to json parsing :\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 import csv import json from datetime import datetime csv_file_path = \u0026#39;output.csv\u0026#39; json_file_path = \u0026#39;output.json\u0026#39; data = [] id = 1790 with open(csv_file_path, \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;) as csv_file: csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file) for row in csv_reader: # Convert date and time to datetime object date_obj = datetime.strptime(row[\u0026#39;date\u0026#39;] + \u0026#39; \u0026#39; + row[\u0026#39;time\u0026#39;], \u0026#39;%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S\u0026#39;) mood=3 if row[\u0026#39;mood\u0026#39;]: mood = int(row[\u0026#39;mood\u0026#39;]) # Prepare data for JSON entry = { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: id, # You can generate an ID here if needed \u0026#34;minute\u0026#34;: date_obj.minute, \u0026#34;hour\u0026#34;: date_obj.hour, \u0026#34;day\u0026#34;: date_obj.day, \u0026#34;month\u0026#34;: date_obj.month-1, \u0026#34;year\u0026#34;: date_obj.year, \u0026#34;datetime\u0026#34;: int(date_obj.timestamp() * 1000), \u0026#34;timeZoneOffset\u0026#34;: 7200000, # Assuming a constant offset \u0026#34;mood\u0026#34;: mood, \u0026#34;note\u0026#34;: row[\u0026#39;note\u0026#39;], \u0026#34;note_title\u0026#34;: row[\u0026#39;note_title\u0026#39;], \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;assets\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;isFavorite\u0026#34;: False } data.append(entry) id += 1 # 2. **Write to JSON File**: Save the transformed data to a JSON file. with open(json_file_path, \u0026#39;w\u0026#39;, encoding=\u0026#34;utf-8\u0026#34;) as json_file: json.dump({\u0026#34;dayEntries\u0026#34;: data}, json_file, indent=2) Difficulties Encountered Daylio export to csv functionnality is using a scale from terrible (1) to wonderful (5) day. That\u0026rsquo;s what I used in Obsidian. The json is storing it in reverse, so I needed to adapt my markdown-to-csv.py script to make it different. Daylio is using some weird numbering on months. January is 0, December is 11. It was what was making my app crash when importing my modified backup. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find out until I tried to just add a random new entry and the month was not the one I specified. Epoch timestamp was using milliseconds, and I was using seconds at first, leading to issues. I needed to find the timeZoneOffset for my region, fortunately, it already exists. I needed to increment an ID, even thought it seems like Daylio does it on backup export only as it is reversed… Don\u0026rsquo;t tell me Daylio is changing the ID of all entries when adding a new one. Please. Anyway, I incremented. Conclusion I managed to move my notes from Obsidian to Daylio, using pandas, manipulating encoded json files, and epoch timestamps. It was fun, and instructive. I became lazy and did not automate the whole process as this is just a one-time job. But I sure hope it\u0026rsquo;ll help some other people.\nSources and Inspirations Sorry but how the f*ck isn\u0026rsquo;t there a 3rd party import option? : r/Daylio Reverse-engineering Daylio backups | Joel Auterson ","date":"2024-01-23T16:47:00+01:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/how-i-reverse-engineered-daylio-backup-to-allow-for-csv-file-importing/","title":"How I Reverse Engineered Daylio Backup to Allow for Csv File Importing"},{"content":"How to Enforce Commit Conventions and Automate the Release and Changelog Process What is What ?

I also discovered Linux and Bash, parallel computing with MPI, and some scripting tools like Ansys APDL for mechanical engineering.\nEven though I manipulated and used a lot of CSS and JS during my Obsidian learning journey, I never really made any project using the three languages of web-dev.\nSo after looking at some project ideas online, I settled on creating a calculator app while looking for a job.\nWhile it might not be the most beautiful one, I did exactly what I wanted to do with it.\nIt is available online here and the source code is public on Github.\nBut how did it end up this way ? Well, let\u0026rsquo;s find out.\nChronology of Dev First Draft First of all, I did a bunch of spaghetti programing to grasp the basics :\nI learned how to organise HTML documents. I learned some CSS basics, but mainly I know how to use Flexbox and Grid. I learned how to write functions in Javascript and use onclick events to call them. But here are the problems I encountered :\nI was doing things while learning by searching for things online. I lacked a structure and goals, I just did what I thought would be great to add. Debugging was manual, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t test that my changes were not breaking things. Rebuild with Object Programming and Unit-testing Now that I knew the functions that I wanted to have on my calculator, I completely rewritten it using a Calculator class. It allowed me to use jest to test the logic part of my app with some unit-testing that I learned on the Openclassroom Java Unit-Testing Course.\nI separated the my app in different parts :\nindex.html for organizing elements. styles.css for styling. script.js for input and eventListeners. Calculator.js for logics and calculations, with an updateViewer() method to update the view. Calculator.test.js for jest unit-testing. I could now use TDD1 to make sure that adding functionalities wasn\u0026rsquo;t breaking anything.\nFixes and Quality of Life Improvement Then I asked some people to try the calculator and I used it myself while comparing it to the calculator provided by Windows. I then planned a few bug fixes and quality of life improvements and integrated them to the app.\nHandling Big Numbers and Loads of Decimals At first, my app was using the javascript eval() function. I know, I could do a parser myself, but the goal of this project was more to practice unit testing while discovering some web-dev, not to break my head against mathematical stuff.\nBut still, how was my calculator handling numbers with loads of decimals ? Well, it was rounding up things badly.\nAnd how was my calculator endling big numbers ? Well, text overflowed.\nSo I needed to fix things up, and I did.\nHow to Handle Number with Decimals ? As always numbers in programming must be handled with care. Javascript numbers are treated using decimal floating point. The issue of such a representation is that addition and other operations could end up with a small rounding error. While it was just a beginner project and the scope wasn\u0026rsquo;t to get a scientific calculator, I still wanted to learn how to implement a library that would manage big numbers and numbers with loads of decimal precisely.\nSo I added mathjs to my project. It uses decimal.js.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a few other alternatives to consider :\nGitHub - royNiladri/js-big-decimal: Work with large numbers on the client side with high precision. GitHub - MikeMcl/decimal.js: An arbitrary-precision Decimal type for JavaScript GitHub - MikeMcl/bignumber.js: A JavaScript library for arbitrary-precision decimal and non-decimal arithmetic GitHub - MikeMcl/big.js: A small, fast JavaScript library for arbitrary-precision decimal arithmetic. And the differences between the last three are explained here.\nSo now, my decimal rounding was working as expected :\n1 2 before : 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004 now : 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3 How to Handle Big Numbers ? Well, I simply limited the user input of numbers to 16 characters and added an overflow and slider to the formula accumulation at the top ! It made playing with huge numbers even more fun !\nConclusion I learned a lot on that side project that occupied me just between sending email for jobs.

The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods, obeying the following rules:\nOnly one disk may be moved at a time. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it. With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves.\nThe minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n − 1, where n is the number of disks.\nHow to Solve it Manually with Three Disks ? Source : Python Program for Tower of Hanoi - GeeksforGeeks\nBasically, with three disks, there is 7 steps. If we use the following notation hanoiMove(source, auxilary, destination), we can further explain the steps :\nhanoiMove(A, B, C) hanoiMove(A, C, B) hanoiMove(C, A, B) hanoiMove(A, B, C) hanoiMove(B, C, A) hanoiMove(B, A, C) hanoiMove(A, B, C) How to Get the Idea of Coding Such a Thing ? Do you know about recursion ? If not, now is your time to learn. I also suggest taking a look at some sorting algorithms to grasp the idea of recursion and how to follow down a tree structure.\nWell, you got the moves in order for a basic scenario with 3 disks, that\u0026rsquo;s what we discussed above.\nAnd here is a basic recursive template to navigate down a solution tree :\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 def recursiveFunction(n, source, auxiliary, destination): if SOMETHING: BASE CASE # When we hit the bottom of the tree RECURSIVE_CALL_GOING_DOWN_LEFT # We go down left # ... # Some actions to do when coming back up before going down # ... RECURSIVE_CALL_GOING_DOWN_RIGHT # We go down right Using such a structure allow us to navigate down solutions in a tree in this order :\nAnd there\u0026rsquo;s 7 steps… Isn\u0026rsquo;t that all too convenient ? Yup, that\u0026rsquo;s because this code template suits our scenario very well.\nNow think about it. The goal of recursion is to solve a problem by gradually shrinking down the problem until we come to a simple scenario.\nThe most basic scenario of a tower of Hanoi would be to have one disk.\nWe would just have to move it to the destination using hanoiMove(n=1, source='A', auxiliary='B', destination='C', hanoi_tower).\nWe should start naming rods now, lets define our rods in the initial setup :\nThe left one is A, it holds our disks initially. The middle one is B, it is empty but will help us get to the right. The right one is C and is our target destination. Going back to our one disk scenario, that\u0026rsquo;ll be our base case:1\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 def hanoiMove(n, source, auxiliary, destination, hanoi_tower): if n==1: # We pop the disk from the source and append it to the destination hanoi_tower[destination].append(hanoi_tower[source].pop()) print(hanoi_tower) return RECURSIVE_CALL_GOING_DOWN_LEFT # ... # Some actions to do when coming back up before going down # ... RECURSIVE_CALL_GOING_DOWN_RIGHT And here is where it gets tricky. What to do next ?\nWell, I might be a simple man, but I just considered my 3 disks scenario. I want my first moves to be these ones :\nhanoiMove(A, B, C) hanoiMove(A, C, B) hanoiMove(C, A, B) hanoiMove(A, B, C) If you look at the former tree, it is the left side of it.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll just use some input permutation on the function calls variable input to get the correct base case for my 3 disks scenario.\nIf our first function call is hanoiMove(3, 'A', 'B', 'C') on the function hanoiMove(n, source, auxiliary, destination).\nWe want the call stack to look like this :\nhanoiMove(3, 'A', 'B', 'C') # First function call hanoiMove(2, '?', '?', '?') # Second function call hanoiMove(1, 'A', 'B', 'C') # Third function call, the one that hits the base case at the bottom left of the tree and is executed first With a tree, it looks like that :\nAlright, so we need our first recursive call RECURSIVE_CALL_GOING_DOWN_LEFT to swap two input variables, so that it comes back to a A → C movement at the bottom.\nIf we look at the second move to solve our tower of Hanoi, the middle disk moves to the auxiliary rod (B), and not the destination (C) one. It\u0026rsquo;s a move from A → B. :\n2. hanoiMove(**A**, C, **B**)\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it, we just need to swap the auxiliary and the destination on our first recursive call :\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 def hanoiMove(n, source, auxiliary, destination, hanoi_tower): if n==1: # We pop the disk from the source and append it to the destination hanoi_tower[destination].append(hanoi_tower[source].pop()) print(hanoi_tower) return # First recursive call, we move the n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary hanoiMove(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, hanoi_tower) # ... # Some actions to do when coming back up before going down # ... RECURSIVE_CALL_GOING_DOWN_RIGHT But doing so, it will never actually move the middle disk from A to B, we need to tell it that when it comes back to the scenario with 2 disks in the tree, it should move the disk. That\u0026rsquo;s why I intentionally left a #Some actions to do in the code template.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 def hanoiMove(n, source, auxiliary, destination, hanoi_tower): if n==1: # We pop the disk from the source and append it to the destination hanoi_tower[destination].append(hanoi_tower[source].pop()) print(hanoi_tower) return # First recursive call, we move the n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary hanoiMove(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, hanoi_tower) hanoi_tower[destination].append(hanoi_tower[source].pop()) print(hanoi_tower) RECURSIVE_CALL_GOING_DOWN_RIGHT Now where are we ? If we sum up, this is our call stack :\nhanoiMove(3, 'A', 'B', 'C') # First function call hanoiMove(2, 'A', 'C', 'B') # Second function call hanoiMove(1, 'A', 'B', 'C') # Third function call, the one that hits the base case at the bottom left of the tree and is executed first And this is the graph :\nAlright, now final part. How to end the recursion with the recursive call to the right.\nIf we come back to our solving steps :\nhanoiMove(A, B, C) hanoiMove(A, C, B) hanoiMove(C, A, B) hanoiMove(A, B, C) Using the same idea, we want our third move to be 3. hanoiMove(**C**, A, **B**), meaning a movement from C → B .\nRemember our call stack :\nhanoiMove(3, 'A', 'B', 'C') # First function call hanoiMove(2, 'A', 'C', 'B') # Second function call hanoiMove(1, 'A', 'B', 'C') # Third function call, the one that hits the base case at the bottom left of the tree and is executed first When the third one is called, it does the base case. Then we come back to the first recursive call :\n2. hanoiMove(2, 'A', 'C', 'B').\nAnd we want our third move to be :\n3. hanoiMove(**C**, A, **B**).\nWell, that settles it. The other recursive call should swap the source and auxiliary in the call.\nSolution to the Problem Here\u0026rsquo;s the whole code :\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 def hanoiMove(n, source, auxiliary, destination, hanoi_tower): # Base case, we just move the disk from the source to the destination if n == 1: # We pop the disk from the source and append it to the destination hanoi_tower[destination].append(hanoi_tower[source].pop()) print(hanoi_tower) return # First recursive call, we move the n-1 disks from the source to the auxiliary hanoiMove(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, hanoi_tower) hanoi_tower[destination].append(hanoi_tower[source].pop()) print(hanoi_tower) # Second recursive call, we move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary to the source hanoiMove(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, hanoi_tower) And the main part :\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 n = 3 # Number of disks source = \u0026#39;A\u0026#39; # Original source rod for the disks auxiliary = \u0026#39;B\u0026#39; # Middle rod destination = \u0026#39;C\u0026#39; # Destination rod # We then initialise the hanoi_tower dictionary with the number of disks hanoi_tower = { \u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [i for i in range(n, 0, -1)], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [] } print(\u0026#34;Initial state :\u0026#34;, hanoi_tower) # Print the initial state of the hanoi_tower hanoiMove(n, source, auxiliary, destination, hanoi_tower) # Solve the puzzle And now you get the whole tree chart :\nI executed the code with n=5 to make sure everything works well :\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: []} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5, 4, 3, 2], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [1]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5, 4, 3], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [2], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [1]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5, 4, 3], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [2, 1], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: []} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5, 4], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [2, 1], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [3]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5, 4, 1], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [2], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [3]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5, 4, 1], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [3, 2]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5, 4], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [3, 2, 1]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [3, 2, 1]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4, 1], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [3, 2]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5, 2], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4, 1], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [3]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5, 2, 1], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [3]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5, 2, 1], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4, 3], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: []} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5, 2], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4, 3], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [1]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4, 3, 2], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [1]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [5], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4, 3, 2, 1], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: []} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4, 3, 2, 1], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [1], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4, 3, 2], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [1], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4, 3], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5, 2]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4, 3], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5, 2, 1]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [3], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5, 2, 1]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [3], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4, 1], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5, 2]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [3, 2], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4, 1], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [3, 2, 1], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [4], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [3, 2, 1], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5, 4]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [3, 2], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5, 4, 1]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [3], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [2], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5, 4, 1]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [3], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [2, 1], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5, 4]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [2, 1], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5, 4, 3]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [1], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [2], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5, 4, 3]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [1], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5, 4, 3, 2]} {\u0026#39;A\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;: [], \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]} Welp, that\u0026rsquo;s about it, I managed to make this work.

Un convertisseur de tension Vechline 600W quasi-sinus Un frigo Trimixte XC-43G de 40L Une pompe à eau Flojet Triplex 2.9 12V 25 psi Et là vous vous dites, et bien parfait, quel est le problème ?\nIl y en a plusieurs :\nIl n\u0026rsquo;y a que le convertisseur et le panneau solaire qui sont protégées par un fusible. Aucun des autres appareils n\u0026rsquo;est aux normes. Le convertisseur de tension est un quasi-sinus, il est donc déconseillé pour les appareils informatiques (téléphones, ordinateurs, etc.) La batterie auxiliaire est reliée directement à la batterie de démarrage lorsque l\u0026rsquo;on enclenche une clef. Malheureusement, cela rend le système soumis à l\u0026rsquo;erreur humaine, et démarrer après avoir branché le système peut provoquer une montée de tension trop brusque pour la batterie auxiliaire. Notre frigo consomme beaucoup trop d\u0026rsquo;électricité (~100W) pour une technologie de refroidissement inefficace. Nous n\u0026rsquo;avons aucun moyen de contrôler le niveau de charge de la batterie. Nous n\u0026rsquo;avons aucun moyen de protéger la batterie auxiliaire en l\u0026rsquo;empêchant de descendre sous les 50% et ainsi respecter son DOD.1 Améliorations Proposées Etant donnée notre consommation prévue d\u0026rsquo;électricité, nous avons conservé la batterie et le système de charge solaire. Nos améliorations ont porté sur :\nAchat et installation d\u0026rsquo;un porte fusible complet pour protéger chaque circuit selon les normes. Changement du convertisseur de tension pour un Victron Phoenix VE.Direct 12/375. Installation d\u0026rsquo;un coupleur séparateur Victron Energy Cyrix-CT 120A.2 Changement du frigo pour une glacière à compression Mobicool MCF40 de 38L. Consommation moyenne de 48W en 12V (~25Ah/24h). Installation d\u0026rsquo;un voltmètre pour contrôler la tension de la batterie. Attention, cela ne suffit absolument pas à connaitre l\u0026rsquo;état de charge d\u0026rsquo;une batterie, un capteur intelligent comme le Victron BMV-712 est requis pour tenir compte de l\u0026rsquo;effet Peukert, mais nous auront tout de même une indication. L\u0026rsquo;ajout d\u0026rsquo;un Victron Battery Protect 65A afin de couper le courant à la batterie si une certaine tension est atteinte et réenclencher le circuit uniquement lorsqu\u0026rsquo;une nouvelle tension jugée suffisante est atteinte. Cela nous permet, en ayant la correspondance tension-capacité restante d\u0026rsquo;une batterie AGM, de bloquer la décharge à 50% de DOD. Du moins, lorsque le panneau solaire ne fonctionne pas : en effet, lorsque le panneau solaire charge la batterie, la tension augmente mais la batterie n\u0026rsquo;a pas pour autant récupéré sa charge. Schéma Électrique Final Remarque : Le câble noir permettant de contrôler l\u0026rsquo;allumage du convertisseur de tension par le batterie protect n\u0026rsquo;a pas été utilisé étant donné que notre convertisseur de tension possède une sécurité intégrée pour éviter les décharges lourdes de batterie.\nDepth of discharge (DoD) is an important parameter appearing in the context of rechargeable battery operation.

Après deux week-ends de test, nous avons pu voir les améliorations qui nous semblaient nécessaires à l\u0026rsquo;acomplissement de notre petit rêve. Et nous avons ainsi rédigé notre petit cahier des charges.\nMesures Et Modélisations La premiere étape de notre travail fut de prendre nos mesures afin de modéliser l\u0026rsquo;état initial du van.\nNous avons donc utilisé Onshape qui propose un outil cloud gratuit et pratique pour collaborer à deux.\nLes Premières Améliorations Rapides Et Pratiques Les premières modification étaient simples à apporter :\nAjout de 2 portes de placard (15x33cm). Ajout de charnières et de loquets sur le placard de la pompe à eau, du réservoir d\u0026rsquo;eau et du système électrique pour obtenir un accès plus rapide et pratique pour y effectuer des modifications ou des réparations à l\u0026rsquo;avenir. Ajout d\u0026rsquo;un petit rangement mural afin d\u0026rsquo;avoir accès facilement à des affaires depuis le lit. Ajout d\u0026rsquo;un support de savon et d\u0026rsquo;éponges pour l\u0026rsquo;évier. Ajout d\u0026rsquo;embouts réducteurs de débit d\u0026rsquo;eau sur le robinet et changement du pommeau de douchette pour un modèle à économie d\u0026rsquo;eau. Ajout D\u0026rsquo;un Placard Complet De Rangement Sous Le Lit A l\u0026rsquo;origine, nous n\u0026rsquo;avions pas d\u0026rsquo;espace de rangement autre que le coffre pour y déposer notre linge ou nos affaires personnelles. Cependant, étant donnés les pays où nous nous dirigions, une situation de pluie le matin et le soir au moment de se changer était plus que probable. Nous devions avoir accès à nos vêtements depuis la zone habitable du van.\nNous avons donc modélisé une solution de placard en lieu et place du poteau de support, et l\u0026rsquo;avons réalisé comme toujours avec des matériaux de récupération.\nAu centre, nous avons conservé deux poteaux de support comme structure porteuse, et nous avons comblé l\u0026rsquo;espace à l\u0026rsquo;aide de panneaux fins de contreplaqué. Chaque placard est fixé à l\u0026rsquo;aide de tasseaux, des charnières pianos servent à l\u0026rsquo;ouverture, et des aimants maintiennent les placards en place lorsque le véhicule est en mouvement. L\u0026rsquo;ajout de chant sur les bandes coupées d\u0026rsquo;agloméré, de poignées et de loquets sur les placards personnels viennent apporter la touche finale de l\u0026rsquo;ouvrage.\nAjout D\u0026rsquo;un Séparateur Sur La Partie Droite Du Coffre L\u0026rsquo;espace à droite du coffre à l\u0026rsquo;origine était trop vertical à nos yeux, il y avait beaucoup de place inutilisée. Nous avons donc ajouté un panneau de contreplaqué découpé sur mesure pour épouser les formes du van.\nLe Système D\u0026rsquo;aération Le gros point faible du van à l\u0026rsquo;achat était son absence d\u0026rsquo;aération. Certes, nous avions une fenêtre latérale à hauteur de tête pour les nuits. Mais non seulement une seule entrée d\u0026rsquo;air ne suffit pas, mais l\u0026rsquo;aspect sécurité était complètement à revoir.\nNous avons donc réalisé une plaque sur mesure qui s\u0026rsquo;adapte à la fenêtre latérale, permet d\u0026rsquo;aérer à l\u0026rsquo;aide d\u0026rsquo;une grille et possède un pare-pluie. Il suffit ainsi d\u0026rsquo;entrouvrir la porte du coffre la nuit tout en la bloquant avec un tendeur pour obtenir un courant d\u0026rsquo;air confortable.\nIsolation Du Van Le van a été isolé par l\u0026rsquo;ancien propriétaire, plus particulièrement le plafond, les murs ainsi que le sol. Cependant, notre van étant un modèle minibus à l\u0026rsquo;origine, nous avions beaucoup de fenêtres.\nNous avions déjà quelques pare-soleils réalisés sur mesure par l\u0026rsquo;ancien propriétaire mais scotchés pour la plupart à l\u0026rsquo;arrache. Nous les avons donc recousus et équipés de petits aimants pour gagner en modularité et permettre de retirer l\u0026rsquo;humidité qui pouvait s\u0026rsquo;y cacher au petit matin.\nLes Ajouts De Dernière Minute Support Pour Bouteille De Gaz Nous avons opté pour des bouteilles de gaz CampinGaz R907. Cependant, nous n\u0026rsquo;avions pas d\u0026rsquo;emplacement spécifique pour stocker la bouteille de gaz autrement qu\u0026rsquo;à même le coffre.\nNous avons donc réalisé un support sur mesure.\nBords De Placard Avec les chutes de bois restantes, nous avons également réalisé des bords de placards pour ajouter un peu d\u0026rsquo;affaires sur la cuisine sans risquer de tout faire tomber en roulant.\nLes Modifications Réalisées Pendant Le Voyage Notons que pendant le voyage, nous avons été contraints de changer le système d\u0026rsquo;eau.\nEn effet, à l\u0026rsquo;origine deux problèmes :\nL\u0026rsquo;eau usée du robinet sortait uniquement sur le côté du van, imposant l\u0026rsquo;usage de produits naturels et l\u0026rsquo;acceptation des locaux. (Impossible en Angleterre) Le bout de l\u0026rsquo;entrée d\u0026rsquo;air du réservoir d\u0026rsquo;eau était positionnée plus bas que son raccord au réservoir ⇒ De l\u0026rsquo;eau pouvait donc entrer depuis le réservoir et s\u0026rsquo;écouler sur notre plancher lors des virages pendant la conduite. Lorsque nous avons malencontreusement cassé le bout de l\u0026rsquo;évacuation d\u0026rsquo;eau usée, nous avons décidé de raccourcir le tuyau et de le relier à un bidon amovible de 5L permettant de conserver nos eaux usées et de pouvoir tout faire à l\u0026rsquo;intérieur du van.\nConcernant l\u0026rsquo;entrée d\u0026rsquo;air, nous avons donc percé un trou sur le côté du placard et installé la sortie d\u0026rsquo;air plus haut que son entrée dans le réservoir afin d\u0026rsquo;éviter les reflux.\n","date":"2023-10-05T12:37:32+02:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/mod%C3%A9lisation-et-r%C3%A9alisation-des-travaux-dam%C3%A9nagement-dun-van/","title":"Modélisation Et Réalisation Des Travaux D'aménagement D'un Van"},{"content":"Modélisation Et Réalisation D\u0026rsquo;un Réchaud À Bois Le 17 Avril 2023, nous sommes partis à l\u0026rsquo;aventure avec ma copine pour 166 jours en Angleterre, au Pays de Galles, en Ecosse et en Irlande.\nA l\u0026rsquo;origine, nous pensions utiliser du bois pour manger le soir, et nous avions donc besoin d\u0026rsquo;un réchaud. Décathlon en proposait un à 50€, mais ayant du temps libre à la fin de nos études, nous avons décidé avec un très bon ami (Grégoire Marie) d\u0026rsquo;en réaliser un nous-mêmes avec les moyens du bord.\nIl a donc réalisé un premier jet de modélisation du Camping Stove sur Onshape selon le cahier des charges que j\u0026rsquo;ai pu établir.\nCi-dessous, nous retrouvons la modélisation ainsi que les plans que nous avons utilisés lors de la fabrication.\nNous avons procédé à la fabrication des pièces et à l\u0026rsquo;assemblage chez nous avec les moyens du bord ainsi que des matériaux de récupération.\nEnfin nous l\u0026rsquo;avons peint et testé, et le concept bien que trop gros pour être pratique dans notre van aménagé nous servira pour des petits barbecues en extérieur !\n","date":"2023-10-05T10:14:12+02:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/mod%C3%A9lisation-et-r%C3%A9alisation-dun-r%C3%A9chaud-%C3%A0-bois/","title":"Modélisation Et Réalisation D'un Réchaud À Bois"},{"content":"Trajet Complet Pour Roadtrip De 6 Mois Au Royaume-Uni Et En Irlande Le 17 Avril 2023, nous sommes partis à l\u0026rsquo;aventure avec ma copine pour 166 jours en France, en Angleterre, au Pays de Galles, en Ecosse et en Irlande.\nOn a quand même réalisé environ 16 000 km de route d\u0026rsquo;après le compteur du van, soit environ 96km par jour. Pour ceux qui ont suivis notre post concernant le budget, on peut dire qu\u0026rsquo;on a vu juste ! Mais au final, quel a été notre trajet ? Eh bien, c\u0026rsquo;est ce qu\u0026rsquo;on va voir aujourd\u0026rsquo;hui.\nVoilà à quoi ressemble le trajet global et nous allons voir plus précisément chaque zone !\nRemarque : Si vous voulez plus de détails sur les visites, nous vous recommandons de jeter un oeil à notre compte Instagram, nous n\u0026rsquo;allons pas tout redétailler ici.\nLa France Départ dans l\u0026rsquo;Ain. Le début du trajet a été un peu fait à l\u0026rsquo;arrache. Dans le sens où le seul objectif court terme était de retourner au Puy de Sancy pour prendre ma (Mathis) revanche sur le sommet qui était couvert la dernière fois. On a eu de la chance, et du soleil ! Et même de la neige, mais bref. On en a profité pour faire d\u0026rsquo;autres puys en Auvergne, tant qu\u0026rsquo;à faire.\nSuite à cela, traversée de la France avec notamment Carennac, Rocamadour, puis l\u0026rsquo;arrivée à Bordeaux pour découvrir la ville avec Julie !\nOn remonte ensuite direction Pont-l\u0026rsquo;Abbé d\u0026rsquo;Arnoult pour un coucou aux grands parents d\u0026rsquo;Elina, et une nuit à Tillou chez Emilie. On profite du coin pour faire l\u0026rsquo;île d\u0026rsquo;Oléron qu\u0026rsquo;on a adorée, et on rejoint Grégoire à Poitiers pour un nouveau week-end en ville !\nOn traverse ensuite à l\u0026rsquo;ouest pour faire toutes les belles falaises de Bretagne, leurs beaux villages, et rencontrer Lilian un très bon pote à Elina ! Mention spéciale à le côte de granite rose qui nous a offert un joli panorama près de Ploumanac\u0026rsquo;h.\nLa suite de l\u0026rsquo;aventure, c\u0026rsquo;est la Normandie et son histoire, des tonnes de musées sur les guerres et le débarquement !\nOn rejoint finalement Calais pour la traversée jusqu\u0026rsquo;en Angleterre.\nSi vous êtes malin, vous apercevez sur l\u0026rsquo;image un trajet qui tire jusqu\u0026rsquo;à l\u0026rsquo;Alsace. Il s\u0026rsquo;agit du retour, mais nous y reviendrons.\nDirection Les Îles ! A l\u0026rsquo;origine, nous voulions faire un tour d\u0026rsquo;Europe. Mais fort est de constater que le Royaume-Uni et l\u0026rsquo;Irlande avaient déjà beaucoup à nous offrir, nous avons donc entrepris un tour complet de ces belles îles et gardons les autres pays pour une autre fois.\nLe Sud De l\u0026rsquo;Angleterre Et Le Pays De Galles Arrivés à Douvres, nous avons commencé par des randonnées sur leur falaises blanches.\nPuis nous sommes allés à Canterbury afin de découvrir les villes anglaises, entre briques et petites boutiques !\nAyant pris un abonnement à English Heritage et à National Trust, nous avons effectué tout un tas de visite comprenant la forteresse de Douvres qui a beaucoup à offrir et énormément de châteaux, jardins et lieux typiques.\nArrivés à Stonehenge, nous y avons dormi et profité du coin.\nNous avons ensuite enchainé de nombreuses zones magnifiques avec Cranborne Chase AONB (on trouve à proximité Stourhead un des plus beaux jardins tenu par National Trust), Dorset AONB, Blackdown Hills AONB, East Devon AONB, Dartmoor National Park et Exmoor National Park. Beaucoup de choses à visiter, de falaises sublimes, et de randonnées sauvages. Un régal, probablement une des choses que nous avons préférées !\nNous sommes ensuite remontés, passant par Cheddar et Bath, deux villes très sympas avant de passer par l\u0026rsquo;authentique Oxford qui donne envie de retourner sur les bancs de la fac !\nPetit passage à Cotswolds AONB, toujours beaucoup de visites dans le coin, avant de tirer à l\u0026rsquo;ouest.\nA Ross-On-Wye, petite frayeur avec un niveau de liquide de frein faible, on fait observer le van et refaire le niveau, pas de fuite détectée, et on repart.\nOn entame le Pays de Galles avec la meilleure ville pour les book lovers, Hay-On-Wye.\nPuis on en prend plein la vue à Brecon Beacons, énormément de belles randonnées et une superbe rencontre : Isaac ! Un local super chouette que nous avons retrouvé plus tard.\nOn enchaine avec Gower AONB, probablement les lieux les plus beaux que vous verrez de votre vie, avec notamment Rhossili Bay.\nPembrokeshire Coast National Park est dans la même idée, avec des plages toutes plus belles les unes que les autres. Le soleil nous accompagne en plus !\nEn remontant la côte, on arrive à Snowdonia pour remonter nos quotas de randonnées en montagne et sur la côte.\nOn fait une pause avec de nouveaux châteaux, jardins et la visite de Caernarfon, une ville très chouette, avant de repartir sur Snowdonia avec un souffle nouveau.\nC\u0026rsquo;est le moment où la fuite du liquide de frein revient. Après un passage à la Clwydian Range \u0026amp; Dee Valley AONB qui ne nous a pas pleinement convaincue, le verdict tombe : le van a une fuite et une pièce de l\u0026rsquo;embrayage est à changer ! Au passage, on demande aussi à changer les pneus avant qui ont souffert des petites routes vallonnées du coin. Nous voilà donc partis pour des vacances forcées au petit village de Llanrwst qui nous a très bien accueilli le temps que le garage puisse s\u0026rsquo;occuper de notre van.\nOn repart plein d\u0026rsquo;énergie pour des visites de châteaux, jardins et randonnées vers Peak District !\nNouveau ralentissement : le garage ne nous avait pas mis les deux mêmes pneus à l\u0026rsquo;avant. Nous voilà repartis pour le Pays de Galles.\nEnfin, on est vraiment libres cette fois et on se dirige vers Lake District !\nLe Nord De l\u0026rsquo;Angleterre Et L\u0026rsquo;Ecosse Nous attaquons Lake District avec une ancienne usine de bobines en bois pour une visite des plus intéressantes : Stott Park Bobin Mill. Puis, on est prêts pour les hostilités et on repart en randonnées avec un temps assez aléatoire mais majoritairement pluvieux.\nL\u0026rsquo;humidité nous fait fuir jusqu\u0026rsquo;au parc national Yorshire Dales où on visite notamment Malham Cove, une formation géologique issue du passage de glaciers, et l\u0026rsquo;immense abbaye de Fountains.\nPause ville à York avant de passer à un nouveau parc national : North York Moors, particulièrement sa côte où on retrouve le beau temps.\nOn enchaîne avec plusieurs musées le long du mur d\u0026rsquo;Hadrien (oui, c\u0026rsquo;est la petite barre horizontale que vous voyez sur le haut de l\u0026rsquo;Angleterre).\nEnfin, nous voilà en Ecosse. On commence directement par la capitale Edimbourg ! Une pensée à Dean Village, un lieu tout mignon au milieu de cette grande ville très sympathique.\nOn découvre les belles plages de l\u0026rsquo;est de l\u0026rsquo;Ecosse avec des cascades qui se jettent dans la mer.\nOn tente quelques randonnées dans le parc national Cairngorms qu\u0026rsquo;on finit par fuir à cause des midges (ces minuscules insectes en essaims qui mordent). Eh oui, l\u0026rsquo;Ecosse n\u0026rsquo;est pas le meilleur pays à faire en juillet-août, il vaut mieux le visiter au printemps.\nOn retourne donc près de la mer car vent = pas de midges et nous voilà partis pour suivre la côte jusqu\u0026rsquo;au bout ! On commence du côté de Bow Fiddle Rock et on remonte par Inverness jusqu\u0026rsquo;au point le plus au nord car nous sommes des complétionnistes !\nDes points de vue superbes, des randonnées en bord de mer, un petit passage au milieu des midges autour de cascades (mais on s\u0026rsquo;est équipés), et on arrive à l\u0026rsquo;île de Skye ! Malheureusement pour nous, les randonnées sont compromises par la présence de nombreux nuages bas. Du positif : ça nous a fait découvrir le musée des Highland Folk, une reconstitution de village local très détaillée !\nUn passage par le légendaire viaduc de Glenfinnan avec le passage du Poudlard Express !\nContrairement à nos plans, on décide de faire la ville de Glasgow. Et on regrette un peu.\nPuis, nous voilà sur un ferry en direction de l\u0026rsquo;Irlande et du ciel bleu !\nL\u0026rsquo;Irlande L\u0026rsquo;Irlande nous accueille avec un super soleil ! Antrim Coast and Glens AONB commence bien avec ses villages côtiers, mais le vrai bonheur se trouve à Causeway Coast AONB. Des vues à couper le souffle, et une première introduction aux pubs Irlandais à Ballycastle. Que de bons souvenirs, notamment la fameuse Giant\u0026rsquo;s Causeway et ses formations rocheuses particulières !\nNotons que beaucoup de tournages de Game Of Thrones ont eu lieu en Irlande du Nord, de quoi motiver les fans ! Mais évitez les plages en van, on a réussi à se bloquer à Benone Beach… Bref.\nOn enchaine avec Derry, et nous insistons sur Derry. En effet, nous avons compris que l\u0026rsquo;histoire de l\u0026rsquo;Irlande est récente. Dans les lieux avec des drapeaux anglais, il faut se considérer en Angleterre. Ailleurs, il faut détester les Anglois avec la même passion qui anime les locaux. Superbe ville propre et sympa !\nPuis musée très instructif : Ulster American Folk Park. C\u0026rsquo;est à Sperrin AONB où les randos sont marrantes, ils ont installé des géants sur les sommets ! La vue était déjà chouette, mais ça rajoute quelque chose il faut l\u0026rsquo;avouer.\nOn part ensuite pour Belfast que nous avons adoré, avec son histoire, sa modernité et sa quantité de street arts de dingue. Nous avons ensuite temporisé Dublin pour que l\u0026rsquo;alignement des astres nous permette d\u0026rsquo;y entrer sans encombre. Nous avons été déçus, non pas que ce soit mauvais (même si leurs transports en commun le sont), mais l\u0026rsquo;âme irlandaise que nous avions trouvée au nord n\u0026rsquo;y était pas. Remarquez, les locaux nous avaient prévenus, au même titre qu\u0026rsquo;il y a la France et il y a Paris, il y a l\u0026rsquo;Irlande et il y a Dublin !\nNous repartons à Donegal pour retrouver l\u0026rsquo;âme irlandaise, et nous partons pour l\u0026rsquo;aventure des falaises en longeant la côte vers le sud. Sans entrer dans le détail, toute la Wild Atlantic Way (WOW) vaut le coup, mention spéciale à Downpatrick Head, les randos de Carrowteige, et Achill Island.\nLes lacs du Connemara nous ont accueillis sous la pluie, mais nous recommandons sous réserve de bonne météo et de période sans midge ! Faites la Sky Road, la vue sur le bout de la côte est… incroyable. Nous sommes redescendus avec quelques arrêts :\nGalway, une petite ville toute mim\u0026rsquo;s sur l\u0026rsquo;après-midi avec son quartier latin et sa grande avenue. Une petite ville emplie de street arts également. Evitez les Cliffs of Moher, inutiles, ou alors prenez le parking plus bas et évitez-vous les 10€ par personne du visitor center. Mais à priori d\u0026rsquo;ici là vous aurez déjà vu les plus belles falaises de vos vies, celles-ci sont évitables, croyez-nous. Dunquin Pier après Dingle, assez touristiques mais valent largement le détour ! Mention très spéciale pour Killarney National Park, une pépite au calme avec d\u0026rsquo;énormes possibilités de randonnées de partout ! Et ça continue jusqu\u0026rsquo;à la pointe ouest avec Kerry Cliffs en passant par la route Ring of Kerry qui vous permet de faire tout un tas d\u0026rsquo;arrêts et de balades également, vraiment un passage recommandé !\nSur le sud on passe par Kinsale, un petit village qui nous a été proposé par une locale, très belle surprise ! Bien plus sympa que Cork que l\u0026rsquo;on ne recommande que pour son aspect centre commercial à ciel ouvert.\nEt après… Ce fut l\u0026rsquo;apocalypse météo puis le Brittany Ferries jusqu\u0026rsquo;à Cherbourg !\nLa France (le retour) Retour au pays. Depuis Cherbourg, nous traçons tout droit jusqu\u0026rsquo;en Alsace. Nous avons fait une petite série de villages dont certains que nous connaissions déjà :\nBergheim → Pas incroyable, mais calme et mignon comme prévu ! On a vite fait le tour par contre. Ribeauvillé → Probablement notre préféré avec sa grande avenue et son âme conservée, le tourisme est présent mais discret, et il y a énormément de caves et de bons restaurants. Et puis c\u0026rsquo;est beau quoi ! Riquewihr → Disneyland de l\u0026rsquo;Alsace avec des parkings hors de prix et inaccessibles en van ou camping-car. Très déçus de la tournure que prend la ville, ses petites boutiques ferment toutes et sont dévorées par les attrapes-touristes. A éviter. Kaysersberg → Toujours aussi mignonne, cette ville d\u0026rsquo;Alsace se présente avec une rivière en son centre, et cela apporte beaucoup à l\u0026rsquo;ambiance ! On adore ! Eguisheim → Aussi touristique que recommandée, nous y sommes allés à la fraicheur du matin avant les trains touristiques. Le tour des \u0026ldquo;remparts\u0026rdquo; qui passe par les petites ruelles remplies de maisons typiques est un must-see du coin ! Et puis finalement, le retour ! Direction la maison, après 166 jours de voyage. Confort retrouvé, mais notre esprit est encore ailleurs. Ce fut une superbe aventure que nous n\u0026rsquo;oublierons jamais.\n","date":"2023-10-04T13:04:17+02:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/trajet-complet-pour-roadtrip-de-6-mois-au-royaume-uni-et-en-irlande/","title":"Trajet complet Pour Roadtrip De 6 Mois Au Royaume-Uni Et En Irlande"},{"content":"Les Applications Indispensables Pour Voyager En Van Au cours de notre voyage, nous avons eu recours à de nombreux applications. Nous vous ferons donc ici une liste complète des applications et sites à avoir sous la main pour pouvoir vivre en van sans problèmes !\nLes Applications De Navigation Petit point important avant de commencer. Quand vous partez pour de la route en van, regardez toujours l\u0026rsquo;itinéraire à l\u0026rsquo;avance, et prenez celui qui compte le plus grand nombre de grands axes. Vous ne gagnerez jamais de temps sur les petites routes à devoir s\u0026rsquo;arrêter pour laisser passer et à galérer avec des routes dégueulasses, même si votre application vous le jure.\nDonc parmi les itinéraires proposés, choisissez le bon. Et pendant la conduite, vérifiez régulièrement que Waze ne vous entourloupe pas. En effet, avec de l\u0026rsquo;expérience, vous apprendrez à voir quand votre GPS vous trouve des fausses bonnes idées, et vous continuerez ainsi tout droit pour gagner du temps plutôt que de l\u0026rsquo;écouter.\nGoogle Maps L\u0026rsquo;incontournable Google Maps pour se renseigner sur des lieux, trouver des visites, enregistrer des lieux pour plus tard et y ajouter des notes. Nous utilisions le système suivant pour enregistrer les lieux et savoir quoi faire chaque jour :\nTravel Plans : Lieux que nous pourrions apprécier autour de nous et valent le coup. Lieux que l\u0026rsquo;on nous recommande également. Favorites : Lieux immanquables ou que nous avons faits et qui nous ont marqués. Want to go : Lieux ayant un intérêt logistique comme les parkings, campings, magasins à faire, etc. Et les cartes peuvent être téléchargées à l\u0026rsquo;avance pour avoir un accès hors connexion, que du bonheur !\nNotons que nous avions commencé le voyage avec Wanderlog, un super outil pour prévoir des petits séjours, mais avec des performances terribles dès que le trajet devient long et surtout une impossibilité d\u0026rsquo;avoir un accès hors connexion sans payer.\nMaps.me Maps.me, au même titre que Routes, OsmAnd, Organic Map, GaiaGPS, Iphigénie, IGNrando, et Geoportail sont des applications de map hors lignes. Certaines gratuites, d\u0026rsquo;autres payantes.\nNous avons utilisé Maps.me par simplicité et gratuité, on télécharge un pays sur son téléphone et on sait qu\u0026rsquo;on aura toujours de quoi se repérer sous réserve d\u0026rsquo;avoir de la batterie. Et ça fait mieux le taf en étant plus précis que Google Maps, même en mode relief.\nCombo Waze Et Camsam Mathis ne jure pour la navigation en véhicule que par Waze et Camsam Plus.\nVous connaissez sûrement Waze et ses fonctionnalités de prévention de danger, travaux et ralentissements. La carte est chouette, et entendre Zerator te gueuler de tourner à droite est un plus.\nEn complément : Camsam et sa base de données précise de positions des radars, et cela fait plus de 6 ans sans un seul PV, et pourtant avec des kilomètres au compteur.\nAttention toutefois, Waze aime bien les raccourcis un peu hasardeux, accessibles et pratiques en Clio tout terrain, mais à éviter en van.\nLes Applications Pour Les Transports En Commun Pour les transports en commun, c\u0026rsquo;est simple : C\u0026rsquo;est chiant.\nGlobalement, Citymapper, Transit et Google Maps devraient suffire, mais comme chaque ville n\u0026rsquo;en fait qu\u0026rsquo;à sa tête… Il vaut mieux avoir les 3 ! Entre horaires précis et trajets pratiques, vous pourrez naviguer sans souci !\nNotons qu\u0026rsquo;en van, vous allez en bouffer vu que la meilleure option reste de se garer en périphérie sur un Park and Ride et de prendre le bus, tram ou métro pour rejoindre le centre ville.\nTrouver Des Lieux De Stationnements Trouver Des Parkings Pour trouver des parkings gratuits, ou peu cher, nous conseillons l\u0026rsquo;usage de Park4Night et de Searchforsites en priorité. Accrochez vous, ces noms reviendront. Ils sont gratuits, et coûtent seulement 10€ et 6€ respectifs par an pour obtenir l\u0026rsquo;accès hors-ligne. Et ce sont de véritables couteaux suisses du van aménagé.\nSi cela ne suffit pas, alors Parkopedia répertorie de nombreux parkings et leurs tarifs.\nEt en dernier recours, Google Maps ou les panneaux !\nPour payer les parkings, vous pouvez utiliser PaybyPhone et RingGo dans la majorité des cas. Cela permet d\u0026rsquo;augmenter à distance la durée de stationnement, mais par contre attention aux zones sans réseau, gardez de la monnaie ou une CB sur place !\nTrouver Des Campings Ou Points De Ravitaillement Pour cela, encore une fois, nous recommandons Park4Night et Searchforsites, principalement Searchforsites pour des campings avec une option de filtre par budget. Park4night étant 90% du temps au Royaume-Uni utilisé par des gens qui trouvent ça normal de payer 35£ la nuit dans un camping douche non incluse. Mais passons.\nNotons que PitchUp est également une pépite pour trouver des campings et aires de repos, mais ce n\u0026rsquo;est qu\u0026rsquo;un site. La version mobile est toutefois plus pratique que le site de base sur ordinateur à l\u0026rsquo;heure de l\u0026rsquo;écriture de ces lignes.\nEnfin, Google Maps comme toujours, et les sites de clubs comme le Friendly Motorhome Club. Beaucoup de lieux hors de prix, mais quelques pépites à 10£ la nuit et avec de quoi s\u0026rsquo;offrir une douche et un ravitaillement complet.\nTrouver Des Toilettes Oui vous en aurez besoin et oui Maps.me, Google Maps et Park4Night sont déjà bons à ce jeu-là. Mais Toilet Finder est une application qui vous sauvera, croyez-nous !\nTrouver Des Itinéraires De Randonnée Pour les itinéraires de randonnée, l\u0026rsquo;incontournable en France reste Visorando. A l\u0026rsquo;étranger, nous avons eu plus de succès avec AllTrails, et parfois Komoot.\nSuivre La Météo La météo sur les iles est imprévisible, donc à prendre avec des pincettes. Mais les meilleures applications actuelles en Europe sont MeteoBlue pour une météo multimodèle ultra précise et avec les couvertures nuageuses pour les sommets, Windy.com pour une carte toute belle et surtout des webcams en temps réel, et enfin Weawow pour une météo sur sa position précise à souhait.\nNotons que MeteoBlue nous a sauvé d\u0026rsquo;une zone inondable une nuit de forte pluie, logiquement beaucoup d\u0026rsquo;applications météo le font mais tant qu\u0026rsquo;à faire ça régale.\nN\u0026rsquo;hésitez pas à consulter les sites nationaux pour une météo globale qui donne les tendances ! Ils peuvent s\u0026rsquo;avérer utiles également avant de se rendre plusieurs jours sur un parc national pour randonner.\nUtiliser Les Wifi Publics Vous ne voulez pas donner votre nom, prénom et mail à n\u0026rsquo;importe quel wifi public ? Utilisez une adresse mail poubelle sur Protonmail, ou alors utilisez des alias avec SimpleLogin ou AnonAddy.\n","date":"2023-10-04T12:46:10+02:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/les-applications-indispensables-pour-voyager-en-van/","title":"Les Applications Indispensables Pour Voyager En Van"},{"content":"Ce Que Notre Voyage En Van Nous a Appris Introduction Nous avons vécu 166 jours dans un contexte complètement différent de celui dans lequel nous vivons habituellement, et ce à travers la France, l\u0026rsquo;Angleterre, le Pays de Galles, l\u0026rsquo;Ecosse et l\u0026rsquo;Irlande.\nCe bouleversement de nos habitudes, mêlé à une plongée dans des cultures différentes de la nôtre a certainement contribué à changer notre vision de la vie, notre façon de penser et d\u0026rsquo;agir. Mais comment ?\nC\u0026rsquo;est ce que nous verrons au cours de ce post avec les différentes leçons que nous tirons de ce voyage. Il y en a sûrement d\u0026rsquo;autres que nous n\u0026rsquo;avons pas encore remarquées, mais il est sûr que nous en sortons différents.\nIl Est Impossible De Trouver La Solution Parfaite Nombre de fois nous avons cherché le meilleur itinéraire, le meilleur camping, la plus sympa des randonnées. Esprit scientifique théorique, toujours à réfléchir et se creuser la tête.\nMais ce voyage nous a mis la barrière du temps dans les dents et nous avons été forcés de prendre des décisions avant d\u0026rsquo;atteindre une solution parfaite. Et ça nous a fait du bien.\nNous sommes désormais beaucoup plus à même de trancher et de partir sur une idée après quelques recherches en acceptant de pouvoir se tromper. Mais donc nous en faisons plus ! Et au pire, on fera mieux la prochaine fois o/\nRéfléchir C\u0026rsquo;est Bien, Faire C\u0026rsquo;est Mieux Eh oui, ce temps gagné à réfléchir juste ce qu\u0026rsquo;il faut nous a fait gagner (ou arrêter de perdre) beaucoup de temps. Qu\u0026rsquo;importe si le spot de ce soir n\u0026rsquo;est pas parfait, nous ferons mieux demain ! Mais profitons donc à fond de cette randonnée que nous sommes en train de faire par exemple.\nMoins d\u0026rsquo;blabla, plus de choses à vivre !\nOn Est Ce Que L\u0026rsquo;on Fait Et puis dans le même ordre d\u0026rsquo;idée, on n\u0026rsquo;est pas seulement ce que l\u0026rsquo;on mange, on est aussi ce que l\u0026rsquo;on fait. Chaque petit choix, acte et habitude compte, que ce soit prendre l\u0026rsquo;escalier au lieu de l\u0026rsquo;escalator ou acheter ou pas cette barre de chocolat quand on a faim.\nMais également comment on réagit par rapport à ce qui nous arrive, et par rapport aux autres. Si on arrive à positiver et être bon même dans le pire scénario, alors on est positif et bon. On a mangé du stoïcisme pendant ce voyage, ça doit se sentir un peu.\nPar exemple le coup de la fuite de liquide de frein qui nous aurait sûrement brisé en deux avec une telle facture au milieu du voyage. Mais finalement, on ne pouvait rien y faire si ce n\u0026rsquo;est accepter et faire avec ce qu\u0026rsquo;on avait sans se démoraliser ! C\u0026rsquo;est ce qu\u0026rsquo;on a fait, et ce fut probablement une des leçons les plus importantes du voyage.\nMais Nous Ne Pouvons Pas Tout Faire Eh oui, c\u0026rsquo;est triste, mais on est tous bloqués par la même barrière : Le temps. Et donc on ne peut pas tout faire, pas toutes les randos de cet endroit, pas tous les endroits cultes du coin, pas tous les restaurants. Mais ce n\u0026rsquo;est pas grave tant que l\u0026rsquo;on fait des choses, à quoi bon penser à ce qu\u0026rsquo;on a potentiellement raté quand on peut voir tout ce qu\u0026rsquo;on a déjà fait !\nLa Meilleure Façon De Ramener Des Souvenirs Est De L\u0026rsquo;associer À Un Souvenir On pense souvent à ramener des bricoles de vacances, mais on ne sait jamais trop quoi. Suite à une discussion avec un écossais, nous avons appris à ne pas ramener un souvenir au hasard, mais à l\u0026rsquo;associer à un lieu ou à une expérience sympa de notre séjour. C\u0026rsquo;est ce que nous avons fait pour des whisky par exemple, l\u0026rsquo;un nous rappelant les côtes est et ses plages et l\u0026rsquo;autre notre mésaventure au parc national avec les midges.\nPlutôt que de chercher le meilleur whisky dans une boutique, autant en ramener pour raconter une histoire associée à son lieu de fabrication ! Et cela compte pour tout un tas de choses !\nVivre À Deux En Permanence C\u0026rsquo;est Possible Elina est habituée des break (🙄), ou d\u0026rsquo;avoir besoin de ses moments pour elle, seule. Et bien finalement ce voyage nous a appris que vive à 2, même dans un si petit espace et en permanence ensemble était possible !\nLe Monde Avance Quoi Qu\u0026rsquo;il Arrive Bloqués dans une sphère de mauvaises nouvelles, notre génération prend un réchauffement climatique, des guerres, des montées des extremes, de la pollution et tout une floppée de mauvaises nouvelles au quotidien.\nVivre loin de l\u0026rsquo;information continue nous a ramené à considérer notre environnement proche plutôt qu\u0026rsquo;une grande échelle zoomée à coup d\u0026rsquo;actualité qui buzz.\nEt quand on revient après 6 mois et que le monde n\u0026rsquo;a pas changé, on se rend compte de notre place si infime dans l\u0026rsquo;immensité de notre planète.\nInutile de s\u0026rsquo;inquiéter outre mesures donc, faire de son mieux et quitter le monde dans un état meilleur que dans celui où il nous à accueillis nous suffira. Faire de son mieux, mais ne pas se détruire la santé à penser à tout !\nS\u0026rsquo;ouvrir A l\u0026rsquo;Autre Eh oui, avec Elina nous sommes relativement discrets avec les inconnus.\nEh bien non seulement nous comprenons désormais les accents anglais les plus terribles, mais nous avons beaucoup plus de facilité à engager la discussion avec des inconnus qu\u0026rsquo;auparavant, même dans une langue différente.\nJe crois également qu\u0026rsquo;Isaac qui a eu le courage de venir nous voir posés devant notre cascade en randonnée nous a inspiré à nous ouvrir aux gens. Tant pis si ça ne prend pas, partager des moments avec d\u0026rsquo;autres est toujours une bonne expérience à vivre.\nL\u0026rsquo;humain Est Bon Mathis particulièrement prend toujours des précautions folles, imagine le pire scénario et part du principe qu\u0026rsquo;il ne faut pas faire confiance aux gens qui pourraient vouloir nous entuber.\nAlors certes, s\u0026rsquo;il s\u0026rsquo;agit en face de SFR ou Bouygues, il faut se méfier. Le nombre de fois où l\u0026rsquo;on s\u0026rsquo;est demandé si on se faisait avoir tellement la personne en face était gentille et faisait pour nous. On se demandait où était l\u0026rsquo;arnaque, si ce n\u0026rsquo;était pas trop gros, on était plutôt méfiants donc.\nAu bout d\u0026rsquo;un moment on a dû considérer une alternative : L\u0026rsquo;humain est simplement parfois, voire souvent, bon. Et ça nous a fait du bien, ce qui nous a également incité à aider les autres.\nQue ce soit en redonnant nos tickets de stationnement, en aidant les personnes qui semblaient perdues, en aidant une dame avec une voiture qui faisait un bruit d\u0026rsquo;enfer à trouver la panne, et tout un tas de situation où nous nous sommes pris à mimer l\u0026rsquo;altruisme des locaux.\nÇa ne nous a pas réussi une seule fois sur un garage pour le dernier changement de pneus. Mais toutes les autres fois où nous nous sommes simplement essayé à donner notre confiance ont été récompensée.\nNotons également que les personnes sont beaucoup plus ouvertes et souriantes au Royaume-Uni et en Irlande. Les croisements de regards sont sans animosité ni gêne contrairement en France. Un sourire est toujours rendu !\nMais alors sommes-nous à fuir ? Certainement pas, le Français aussi est bon. Mais nous sommes très individualistes et cela se ressent, les gens sont dans leur bulle en Europe continentale et sont moins soudés particulièrement en ville. Nous pouvons certainement tous changer cela ne serait-ce qu\u0026rsquo;en commençant par sourire et penser aux autres un petit peu plus au quotidien.\nNotons que je me suis rendu compte du plaisir que j\u0026rsquo;éprouve à aider des gens, ce qui m\u0026rsquo;a inspiré à créer ce site et partager mes astuces, ou à aller plus facilement vers les autres !\nLes Francais Sont Véritablement Des Râleurs Après tout ce temps passé sur les iles, nous sommes retournés en France. Et nous avons été choqués d\u0026rsquo;une chose : Nous râlons, nous nous plaignons, et nous critiquons énormément.\nQue ce soit dans nos small talks dans les boutiques, lorsque l\u0026rsquo;on croise des gens, quand on retrouve nos amis et nos familles… Nous avons été choqués par le temps et l\u0026rsquo;énergie que nous passons en tant que Français à baigner dans du négatif, et ce même en vacances !\nQue ce soit pour se plaindre d\u0026rsquo;une situation proche ou de l\u0026rsquo;état du monde, grogner contre sa femme ou encore critiquer un absent (qui a toujours tort), nous sommes des experts.\nMais pourquoi l\u0026rsquo;avons-nous remarqué ? Nous avons passé beaucoup de temps à discuter avec des locaux et à écouter les gens autour de nous, leur discours était beaucoup plus souvent positif ou neutre dans le pire des cas.\nLes gens prennent du plaisir à aider leur prochain et se rendre utile, rendre service est une vertu. Le meilleur exemple que nous avons concerne les boutiques. En France, si quelqu\u0026rsquo;un se pointe 10min avant la fermeture d\u0026rsquo;un magasin, il risque de se faire jeter. Au Pays de Galles un samedi soir, la vendeuse a rallumé tous les postes pour me récupérer mon colis 1h après la fermeture du bureau de poste, tout ça pour me dépanner puisque nous ne pouvions pas attendre lundi. Et avec le sourire !\nSerait-ce dû à leur météo déjà trop grise qui les force à positiver ? Est-ce la couleur de leurs maisons qui les rend bienveillants ? Aucune idée, mais le constat est là, les habitants de ces iles étaient bien plus humains et bienveillants dans la globalité.\nDe notre côté nous nous sommes adonnés au jeu de la gratitude et de la positivité pour changer notre façon de voir les choses pendant ce voyage, aidés par l\u0026rsquo;attitude des locaux, nous trouvons que nous considérons le monde d\u0026rsquo;un nouvel oeil, tourné plutôt vers les bonnes choses.\n","date":"2023-10-04T12:19:00+02:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/ce-que-notre-voyage-en-van-nous-a-appris/","title":"Ce Que Notre Voyage En Van Nous a Appris"},{"content":"Budget Pour Voyager En Van Pendant 6 Mois Le 17 Avril 2023, nous sommes partis à l\u0026rsquo;aventure avec ma copine pour 166 jours en France, en Angleterre, au Pays de Galles, en Ecosse et en Irlande.\nLa question que tout le monde nous pose :\nEt voyager en van, combien ça coûte ?\nEh bien nous allons essayer d\u0026rsquo;y répondre au mieux dans ce post.\nAcheter Un Van Et L\u0026rsquo;aménager, Combien Ça Coûte ? Nous avons acheté notre van 8000€ en juillet 2022. Ce dernier était un Renault Master II de 173098 km, déjà aménagé avec lit, électricité, eau, et réfrigérateur.\nNous avons effectué de nombreux travaux sur le van, notamment des aménagements intérieurs et la refonte complète du réseau électrique.\nCes travaux ont un coût, auquel il faut rajouter le coût de la révision que nous avons fait avant de partir, comprenant le changement de 4 pneus, et de rotules de train avant. Un petit total à 1101,46€.\nEt au total, l\u0026rsquo;aménagement et tout le matériel acheté pour le van nous ont coûté 1466,78€ par personne, soit un total de 2933,56€. Nous avions prévu un total de 2000€ mais avons dû rajouter la refonte du panneau électrique et une glacière à compression, nous propulsant un peu au-delà de nos attentes. Notons aussi que nous avons un peu \u0026ldquo;triché\u0026rdquo; en ajoutant les courses du départ dedans, et beaucoup de petits objets pratiques : Bassines, boites de rangement, etc.\nRemarquez, comme on a prévu large de partout, on est bons.\nPréparer Son Budget De Voyage Pour préparer notre budget, nous étions partis sur 8 mois de cavale, comprenant mars à octobre.\nPour chaque mois, nous avons préparé les dépenses dans leur ensemble :\nL\u0026rsquo;essence, budget principal. Préparé sur le pire scénario, à savoir 2€/L, une consommation de 10L/100km et une moyenne de 100km par jour. Les différents transports, notamment les ferries ou la traversée du tunnel sous la Manche. Les campings à raison d\u0026rsquo;un par semaine à 15€ la nuit. Prix choisi d\u0026rsquo;après la moyenne en France (cry in tarif anglais exorbitant). Les parkings (parfois plus chers que pour une voiture). Les courses. Les sorties en restaurants ou cafés à raison de 2 restaurants par mois. Le gaz, à raison d\u0026rsquo;une bouteille par mois pour être larges. Les laveries à raison d\u0026rsquo;une fois toutes les deux semaines à 15€. Les activités et visites. Les souvenirs pour nous et pour nos proches. Les dépenses personnelles. L\u0026rsquo;assurance du van tous les mois. On arrive à un joyeux total de 12000€, soit 6000€ par personne pour 8 mois de voyage ! Une somme rondelette, mais quand on voit le prix des locations à la semaine (van ou appartement hein), on se dit que somme toute, on est dans la tranche économe du voyage-game.\nLa Réalité ? Pour suivre nos dépenses, nous sommes des adorateurs de la méthode de l\u0026rsquo;enveloppe,1 largement enseignée à Mathis par YNAB il y a quelques années. Nous avons utilisé YNAB donc pour suivre les dépenses de Mathis, et Splitwise pour tenir compte des dépenses d\u0026rsquo;Elina. Les deux étant synchronisés par leurs API et un peu de magouille, un setup complexe mais fonctionnel qui nous donne des graphiques de dépenses précis !\nLe voyage nous a couté 4872,29 € par personne, soit 9744,58€.\nNous avons voyagé 166 jours, cela nous fait un budget total de 58,7€ par jour, et donc de 29,35€ par jour et par personne. Ce qui fait pour le côté nourriture (courses et restaurants) 10,4€ par jour et par personne. Un peu plus de 3€ le repas, on est restés au Crous en fait !\nNotons que faire des cartes de fidélité à Morrisons ou ailleurs est une très belle option à envisager pour faire des économies, comme toujours. Idem utiliser des sites de cashback pour les achats de billets de ferries.\nDonc au total, achat, aménagement et voyage compris, on arrive à :\n20 678,14€ pour deux 10 339,07€ par personne Il nous reste la révision après voyage et le contrôle technique avant vente tout de même, les dépenses ne sont pas terminées mais elles seront aussi compensées par la vente.\nBref, on est bien. Et on a bien profité !\nAlors effectivement pour les plus attentifs, nous ne sommes pas parti en mars car nous avions encore notre CDD jusqu\u0026rsquo;en avril. Et le départ début avril a été repoussé pour qu\u0026rsquo;Elina puisse se préparer (ayant fini de travailler plus tard), et pour finir la refonte du réseau électrique qui fut retardée par… Chronopost. On balance ici. Au final, perdre mars et octobre n\u0026rsquo;était pas un problème étant données la température et la météo, on est presque contents d\u0026rsquo;avoir pu se concentrer sur les beaux jours uniquement !\nEt sachant tout ce que nous avons pu faire, et les pépins mécaniques que nous avons eu… J\u0026rsquo;estime que nous nous en sommes très bien sortis ! Eh oui, plus de 1000 balles de frais au Pays de Galles pour changer le cylindre récepteur d\u0026rsquo;embrayage, l\u0026rsquo;embrayage et deux pneus, et rebelotte en Irlande pour deux nouveaux pneus avant. L\u0026rsquo;état de leurs routes et un problème de parallélisme n\u0026rsquo;ayant pas aidé, heureusement que le budget était tout de même large !\nComment Réussir À Tenir Un Budget ? Déjà, on ne le répètera jamais assez, mais prévoyez large.\nSur un voyage long comme ça, on commence radin. Eh oui, pas de plan précis du voyage, les pépins mécaniques peuvent arriver et on ne connait pas encore le coût des choses. Mais plus le voyage avance, plus on peut réévaluer nos dépenses et ainsi se faire de plus en plus plaisir financièrement parlant. C\u0026rsquo;est du moins ce qui nous est arrivé.\nPour l\u0026rsquo;essence, nous avions pris le pire scénario, et comme il s\u0026rsquo;agit de notre plus grande dépense avec les courses, nous avons bien économisé. Faut dire que l\u0026rsquo;essence était entre 1,6 et 1,8 pendant la majeure partie du voyage et non pas 2€/L. Et que nous avons consommé un peu moins que les 10L/100km prévus.\nPour les courses, beauuuucoup de conserves, des sandwichs que nous faisions le midi, des fruits, et peu de superflu. On évite les chips, les gâteaux hors de prix, etc. Bon on a craqué quelques fois, mais l\u0026rsquo;important était de se tenir à notre budget. Et cela nous a réussi aussi bien financièrement que physiquement étant donnée l\u0026rsquo;énergie qu\u0026rsquo;on avait chaque jour et à quel point nous avons séché. De belles habitudes de vie prises, et en plus des économies de faites ! La viande peu chère et de qualité des îles a aidé. Notons quand même que nous avons réajusté notre budget de 125€ par personne et par mois à un peu moins de 200€, pour manger bien et parce que nous le pouvions !\nAu niveau des restaurants, on avait sous-estimé les arrêts en cafés. Toujours en surveillant le budget, les cafés restaient fréquents et on ne les avait pas comptés dans le budget initial. Mais, comme d\u0026rsquo;hab, on prévoit large et on n\u0026rsquo;a pas dépassé notre budget pour autant.\nParenthèse gaz, nous avons utilisé seulement 2 bouteilles R907 de gaz pour le voyage complet ! On s\u0026rsquo;attendait à largement plus, sachant qu\u0026rsquo;on faisait chauffer matin, midi et soir au début. Sûrement une économie grâce aux sandwichs le midi.\nPour les visites, nous avons économisé un max en prenant l\u0026rsquo;abonnement des locaux : English Heritage et National Trust. Visites et parkings gratuits dans la plupart des lieux, ça aide. Surtout vu le prix des visites dans ces pays. On a fait un peu d\u0026rsquo;à côté, déjà la plupart appartiennent à l\u0026rsquo;une des deux entités, et ceux qui n\u0026rsquo;y figurent pas sont pour la plupart des attrapes touristes. Ou alors nous avions déjà visité des lieux similaires, et/ou gratuits ! Il faut dire que sur 6 mois, rater une visite on s\u0026rsquo;en fiche, tout est tellement beau et intéressant qu\u0026rsquo;on se rattrape.\nNotons quand même que de nombreux lieux gratuits et peu connus sont beaucoup plus intéressants que les lieux touristiques, nous pensons notamment à Downpatrick Head par rapport à Cliff of Moher, voire au sud du Pays de Galles par rapport aux Cornouailles.\nLes transports en ferry sont peu onéreux si on s\u0026rsquo;y prend tôt, et pas que. D\u0026rsquo;Ecosse en Irlande, le trajet le moins cher toute période confondu, nous l\u0026rsquo;avons trouvé au comptoir de la compagnie 2h avant l\u0026rsquo;embarquement.\nNotons quand même que pour trouver des campings de qualité mais pas cher, nous recommandons Park4Night, Searchforsites et PitchUp. Ce trio gagnant permet de trouver à coup sur un endroit sympa.\nPour les parkings, le même trio suffit mais on remplace PitchUp par Parkopedia.\nPour plus d\u0026rsquo;applications utiles en van, nous avons réalisé un autre post sur le sujet.\nEn conclusion, on a fait quelques ajustements selon les catégories mais, même avec les petits pépins mécaniques, on est en-dessous du budget prévisionnel du voyage (on avait dépassé sur celui du pré départ, ça compense) et ça, c\u0026rsquo;est agréable !\nConclusion (pour Faire Plaisir À Elina) Voyager, ce n\u0026rsquo;est pas forcément cher. Mais il faut penser à beaucoup de choses, bien prévoir le tout et trouver les bons plans de partout ! Mais c\u0026rsquo;est possible !\nEn tout cas, même avec les coûts d\u0026rsquo;entretien, il vaut mieux acheter un van pour un voyage long, les locations étant hors de prix.\nEt voyager en van reste bien plus abordable et confortable (au sens où l\u0026rsquo;on peut faire ce que l\u0026rsquo;on veut sans avoir beaucoup d\u0026rsquo;impératifs dans les journées) que les voyages traditionnels. On ne regrette pas !\nMéthode qui consiste à allouer une somme d’argent prédéfinie à différentes catégories de dépenses représentées par des enveloppes physiques ou virtuelles.

Rappelons que nous sommes partis le lundi 17 avril 2023 et sommes rentrés le 29 septembre 2023, un périple de 166 jours.\nLa Marche Durant ce voyage, nous avons… beaucoup marché. Mais alors, beaucoup marché. Globalement, que ce soit par le nombre de visites qu\u0026rsquo;on s\u0026rsquo;est faits chaque jour, ou par la tonne de randonnées dans des endroits magnifiques, on a bien fait fonctionner nos p\u0026rsquo;tites jambes.\nAu total, nous avons effectué 2 097 421 pas en 166 jours, soit une moyenne de 12 635 pas quotidien. Si on converti, on avoisine les 1648,13 km au total, soit une moyenne de 9,93 km quotidien. Nous vous attendons avec vos podomètres de téléphone pour faire le kikimeter.\nSur les marches et randonnées enregistrées uniquement, on retrouve 1060,54 km au total, une moyenne de 6,39 km par jour donc.\nDans la même idée, nous avons gravi 9500 étages, soit une moyenne quotidienne de 57 étages au quotidien. Rappelez-vous maintenant de la dernière fois que vous avez monté un 4 étages sans ascenseur en rentrant du taf.\nDis comme ça… Remarquez, je ne sais pas si le fait que ces valeurs soient généralement concentrées en une journée par une randonnée soit une bonne ou une mauvaise nouvelle. Mais gardons ça en tête.\nLe Reste ? Au début du voyage, en France donc, nous avons pu courir un peu et Mathis a pu faire de la muscu plusieurs fois. Que ce soit dans la salle de sport de Grégoire, sur des terrains de street workout ou sur des parcours santé. Mais vu la disponibilité de ceux-ci sur les îles et les journées déjà bien remplies, nous n\u0026rsquo;avons pas pu continuer sur notre lancée ! On s\u0026rsquo;est donc rattrapés sur de giga randonnées, et on reprendra le reste au retour.\nLe Résultat ? Entre tout ce sport et une alimentation sans excès à part quelques glaces et deux ou trois tablettes de chocolat, le verdict est sans appel.\nMathis est passé de 71.5 kg le 16 avril 2023 à 66.5 kg le 01 octobre 2023. C\u0026rsquo;est un retour au poids de sortie de lycée, outch. Plus qu\u0026rsquo;à retravailler pour ce petit muscle perdu au combat.\nElina n\u0026rsquo;a pas bougé, les diététiciennes la déteste.\nAparté Sur La Notion De Vacances En Van En vrai, nous vous taquinons sur l\u0026rsquo;aspect vacances par rapport au sport effectué mais nous aimerions rajouter un point sur le sujet. Partir en van aménagé sommairement n\u0026rsquo;est pas sans contrainte, certes on dort sur des paysages de dingue (et encore, pas toujours), mais il y a tout une logistique à gérer ! Voici une liste des choses à prévoir au quotidien :\nTrouver un spot dodo pour le soir, autorisé, sans jeunes qui font la bringue sur place (fréquent sur les îles), sans habitation ou route juste à côté. Oui, c\u0026rsquo;est simple en nature (sauf quand c\u0026rsquo;est, comme beaucoup de fois, interdit en zone naturelle), mais fun fact : Notre société a bien su mettre de côté la nature, et du reste sur les îles, tout appartient à quelqu\u0026rsquo;un ! Alors il faut y aller à grand coup de Park4Night et Searchforsites et parfois pendant un moment. Gérer les vides et les pleins. Est-ce qu\u0026rsquo;il nous reste suffisamment d\u0026rsquo;eau potable ? Devons-nous vider les bidons d\u0026rsquo;eau sale ? Est-ce que les toilettes sont vides ? Oh et tiens, la poubelle déborde. Bref, le tout loin de chez soi, avec des possibilités d\u0026rsquo;approvisionnement et de vidage dépendant énormément du lieu. Parfois tout se fait sans difficulté, mais certaines zones demandent plus d\u0026rsquo;anticipations que d\u0026rsquo;autres. Gérer la bouffe, à la maison c\u0026rsquo;est simple, en van la place est limitée, tout comme l\u0026rsquo;énergie électrique. L\u0026rsquo;anticipation est la clef, pour tout. Les laveries. Il faut en trouver une correcte, qui fonctionne, pas trop chère, et qui soit disponible ! Ca peut paraitre simple en France dans certains lieux ou à la maison, mais c\u0026rsquo;est parfois une tout autre histoire selon les régions et pays. Surtout que les laveries Revolution ne cochent aucun des cases précédemment citées, et sont parfois les seules options. Veiller à ne jamais manquer de gaz. Cela peut paraître bête, mais ne pas pouvoir finir de cuire son plat à 21h sous la pluie, c\u0026rsquo;est dommage. Ayez toujours un p\u0026rsquo;tit campingaz de randonnée de secours au cas où. Niveau confort, le van n\u0026rsquo;offrait qu\u0026rsquo;un lit, des rangements, et un sol. Mais le lit n\u0026rsquo;était pas utilisable la journée. Donc nous vivions dehors ou au sol contre un placard. Cela doit vous rappeler des souvenirs d\u0026rsquo;entre les cours au lycée, c\u0026rsquo;est normal. Tentez de vous rappeler ce que votre dos vous disait tous les soirs, eh bien oui, nous aussi. Bon après on fait exprès ici de sortir tous les côtés \u0026ldquo;pénibles\u0026rdquo; de la vie en van, évidemment que c\u0026rsquo;est un pur bonheur sur tout le reste, mais comme toujours, il y a des plus et des moins et aucun n\u0026rsquo;est à négliger. Et bien que ce voyage fut génial, il ne fut certainement pas de tout repos. Mais si on l\u0026rsquo;a fait, c\u0026rsquo;est que nous avions estimé que le jeu en valait la chandelle !\n","date":"2023-10-04T12:18:35+02:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/un-voyage-de-6-mois-en-van-cest-du-sport/","title":"Un Voyage De 6 Mois En Van, C'est Du Sport"},{"content":"Les Grandes Différences Entre La France, l\u0026rsquo;Angleterre, Le Pays De Galles, l\u0026rsquo;Ecosse Et l\u0026rsquo;Irlande Introduction Bien le bonjour ! A la suite de notre petit périple, on a encore plein de petites choses à raconter, notamment toutes ces choses qui nous ont marquées et qui changent de notre douce France.\nLa Route Eh oui, évidemment, la première chose que nous avons découvert en Angleterre à notre arrivée à Douvres est la route. On roule à gauche, jusqu\u0026rsquo;ici il suffit de prendre l\u0026rsquo;habitude. Mais la comparaison ne s\u0026rsquo;arrête absolument pas là.\nLa Signalisation La première chose qui frappe est la différence de mentalité sur la signalisation. En France, on a de bon gros panneaux bien frappant visibles de loin. En Angleterre, la majeure partie de la signalisation se trouve sur la chaussée, et les panneaux de vitesse sont minuscules, la taille d\u0026rsquo;une main ! Et ces panneaux ne sont même pas forcément positionnés du côté où l\u0026rsquo;on circule. Le regard habituellement porté très loin en France se retrouve donc généralement sur la chaussée ou proche. Et si des véhicules sont sur les marquages au sol ? Et bah cheh, bon courage pour sortir au bon endroit !\nEn tout cas dans les bonnes idées, ils possèdent également des zones keep clear où aucun véhicule ne doit être positionné pour permettre de fluidifier le trafic et le passage des secours.\nNotons que les feux de signalisation ne fonctionnent pas de la même manière que nous. Ici on ne laisse pas passer deux entrées de feu en même temps, ceux en face n\u0026rsquo;auront pas le feu vert en même temps que vous, ce qui vous permet de tourner directement sans laisser passer la circulation venant en sens inverse. Mais du coup l\u0026rsquo;attente peut paraitre interminable, d\u0026rsquo;autant plus que les piétons ont leur propre timing de passage qui passe tous les feux véhicules au rouge.\nInformation rigolote : il est possible de commencer à rouler quand le feu passe du rouge au orange avant de passer au vert. Une transition que nous n\u0026rsquo;avons que pour l\u0026rsquo;arrêt sur le continent.\nNotons la présence de panneaux rigolos comme les traversées de vieux, de grenouilles, de canards, de vaches ou encore de personnes à mobilité réduite. Ou encore le fameux traversée de piétons sur une 2x2 voies à 70 mph (113km/h).\nEt d\u0026rsquo;ailleurs en village, les limitations sont généralement à 64km/h voire 80km/h, avec des passages à 48km/h assez rares finalement.\nLa Courtoisie Au Volant Heureusement pour nous, les Anglois sont courtois au volant. Et je vous jure, ce n\u0026rsquo;est pas qu\u0026rsquo;un cliché. Qu\u0026rsquo;est-ce qu\u0026rsquo;ils sont aimables, à laisser passer les autres, sourire, et se faire des grands signes de remerciement (dont des gros pouces). La France a beaucoup à apprendre de leur comportement sur la route !\nLes Parkings Une habitude terrible des Anglais, en lien avec leur problème fondamental de parking, est le fait de se garer n\u0026rsquo;importe où. Littéralement, tous les bords de route sont emplis de véhicules dans les villages et villes, imposant de laisser passer les véhicules en face. Leur courtoisie ne sort pas de nulle part, ils ont bien dû s\u0026rsquo;y mettre pour ne pas devenir fou.\nDans le même ordre d\u0026rsquo;idée, ils s\u0026rsquo;arrêtent n\u0026rsquo;importe où sans le signaler. Et cela semble normal, en plein virage ou autre. Etrange.\nNotons également que leur capacité à se garer dans une place est rudimentaire. Ils prennent des coussins de chaque côté de leur véhicule plus gros qu\u0026rsquo;un jeu gonflable pour enfants si on ne leur indique pas la place avec des traits. Remarquez, quand la place est bien démarquée, ils trouvent toujours le moyen de se foutre n\u0026rsquo;importe comment. Non sincèrement ce pays a un problème avec le parking de manière général, c\u0026rsquo;est culturel.\nL\u0026rsquo;état Des Routes Enfin, l\u0026rsquo;état des routes. Surtout en l\u0026rsquo;Angleterre et au Pays de Galles, puisque la situation s\u0026rsquo;améliore en Ecosse et que malgré l\u0026rsquo;étroitesse des routes Irlandaises, ce n\u0026rsquo;était rien comparé aux deux premiers cités. Car oui, l\u0026rsquo;Angleterre et le Pays de Galles ont des routes parfois minuscules, mais toujours remplies de nid de poules ou de saloperies qui vont réduire vos pneus en miettes.\nNotons la présence de haies sur les côtés qui n\u0026rsquo;aident pas à agrandir la route ou la visibilité, ni leurs bumpers au centre de la route qui lacèreront vos pneus puisque vous serez trop large pour tenir intégralement dans la partie gauche de la route.\nLa Vie En Van Au Royaume-Uni, notre vie en van a beaucoup changé.\nDéjà les toilettes publiques. Je ne vous fait pas un dessin, en France si vous avez de la chance vous tombez sur des toilettes corrects sans PQ ni cuvette, mais généralement c\u0026rsquo;est toilettes turcs bouchées. Au Royaume-Uni et en Irlande, les toilettes publiques sont luxueuses, chaleureuses, accueillantes. C\u0026rsquo;est un bonheur pour vos p\u0026rsquo;tites fesses. Sauf quand elles sont payantes, mais bon, heureusement ce n\u0026rsquo;est pas toujours le cas.\nLe camping est également très luxueux, parfois trop, si bien qu\u0026rsquo;on a galéré pour trouver des campings abordables plus d\u0026rsquo;une fois. Mais la prestation est d\u0026rsquo;un autre niveau qu\u0026rsquo;en France à égal budget, beaucoup plus intime avec des douches et lavabos individuels et des toilettes de qualité.\nEnfin en van, trouver un endroit qui n\u0026rsquo;appartient pas à un landlord est compliqué. Avec les bonnes applications, ça se fait, mais il faut bien s\u0026rsquo;y prendre. La quantité de spots en bord de route, les fameux lay-by, sans aucune alternative à portée est énorme. Il faut se préparer mentalement à passer quelques mauvaises nuits sur le séjour, là où en France de nombreux villages mettent à disposition des aires de repos tout équipées avec eau propre, vidanges et poubelles !\nEn parlant de vidange et de poubelles, il faut croire qu\u0026rsquo;ils n\u0026rsquo;en ont pas. Ou peu du moins, vider les ordures fut généralement un enfer et nous avons dû stocker du sac comme jamais. Sans parler du nombre d\u0026rsquo;endroits avec poubelles où il est interdit de jeter ses déchets domestiques. Mais on vit dans notre van, et vous n\u0026rsquo;avez rien de public, alors comment faisons-nous ? Bref, effectivement sur ça aussi, la situation était plus simple en France.\nLa Relation À L\u0026rsquo;argent Est-ce l\u0026rsquo;influence des Etats-Unis ? A moins que ce ne soit les Anglais qui ne les aient influencés à l\u0026rsquo;époque ? En tout cas, le capitalisme est fort ici.\nTrouver des parkings gratuits relèvent d\u0026rsquo;un effort intense ou d\u0026rsquo;un miracle, les campings sont à des tarifs exorbitants qui ne choquent plus, et dès que les Anglais voient une souche ou un tronc d\u0026rsquo;arbre mort, ils ne peuvent s\u0026rsquo;empêcher d\u0026rsquo;y enfoncer une pièce.\nRemarquez, tout cela ne les empêche pas d\u0026rsquo;être une nation généreuse, la quantité de dons et de lieux fonctionnant par le biais de donations est incroyable. Les donations sont parfois assez largement conseillées, l\u0026rsquo;incitation à la limite de l\u0026rsquo;obligation. Sachez toutefois que cela fait partie des coutumes.\nEnfin coutume ou pas, il peut se gratter celui qui attend recevoir mes 10£ pour garer mon van sur un bord de route dans un champ. Vindieu que c\u0026rsquo;était courant ça.\nLes Visites Nous avons déjà parlé du prix des parkings, mais les visites sur les îles étaient coûteuses. Du genre régulièrement de 15 à 30£ par adulte. Ayant vu ces tarifs à Douvres et après une petite panique sur ce qu\u0026rsquo;on foutait en terres de bourgeoisie, nous avons trouvé des bons plans : English Heritage et National Trust. Des organismes qui proposent des \u0026ldquo;abonnements\u0026rdquo; annuels qui permettent de profiter de tous les lieux proposés, visites guidées et parkings inclus gratuitement !\nEncore une fois, beaucoup de recours à la donation dans les musées, et il serait mal vu de ne pas y laisser un billet ou un coup de carte bleue en partant. Remarquez, ça vous regarde, mais sachez que dépendant du lieu vous serez amenés à faire des dons par pression sociale.\nEn randonnée, vous allez rencontrer énormément de barrières séparant des prés ou des clôtures pour l\u0026rsquo;abondance d\u0026rsquo;animaux d\u0026rsquo;élevage. Vous verrez, c\u0026rsquo;est simple à refermer, alors ne faites pas comme 90% des touristes à laisser tout ouvert ! En plus elles sont plus pratiques que chez nous !\nLa Vie De Manière Générale Nous avons remarqué tout une série de petites choses qui diffèrent entre nos pays.\nEn café et bar, vous ne trouverez quasiment jamais le prix ni le degré alcool d\u0026rsquo;une bière. Heureusement pour nous, les bières sont moitié moins chères que chez nous, mais ça nous a un peu fait peur au début !\nNotons qu\u0026rsquo;en parlant de tarif, ici les supérettes et commerces de bord de route ne sont pas spécialement plus chers que les grandes surfaces ! En tout cas dans une dimension bien différente des boutiques d\u0026rsquo;autoroute ou de villages perdus en France qui ont des prix triplés.\nLes filles et femmes portent beaucoup plus de belles robes longues que chez nous l\u0026rsquo;été, un fait qui nous a particulièrement marqué à Oxford dans les parcs.\nLes maisons se ressemblent énormément, mais avec leurs petits changements personnels. Par exemple, une rue complète peut avoir le même modèle de maison, mais la couleur des murs, les volets, le type de porte, les avancées de porte ou les toitures peuvent les différencier, donnant un style très chouette au quartier.\nLes bâtiments en brique sont très nombreux, beaucoup plus que chez nous. Mais le mieux reste les couleurs et les jardins à l\u0026rsquo;avant des maisons, qui sont monnaie courante ici mais qui manquent terriblement à nos villes tout de béton et de gris/blanc impersonnel au possible.\nLes bancs sont quasiment tous sponsorisés ici, mais pas pour une entreprise, plutôt en l\u0026rsquo;hommage à des personnes ayant vécu aux alentours. De petits poèmes ou mots y sont généralement ajoutés, permettant de remercier les défunts ou de partager leur histoire.\nIl existe aussi des bancs où l\u0026rsquo;objectif est de rencontrer des gens en s\u0026rsquo;y asseyant, sans complexe, rien que pour discuter. Une pratique que nous avons retrouvée avec des bars où il était interdit de venir en groupe pour favoriser la rencontre et l\u0026rsquo;échange. Ce qui rend bien compte de la mentalité différente des Anglais, adeptes du small talk en permanence et des bonnes petites blagues. Leur sarcasme étant légendaire.\nNotons, et ceci concerne principalement Mathis, que les hommes relâchent leur sphincter lors de leur passage aux toilettes, même en urinoirs. Et c\u0026rsquo;est normal.\n","date":"2023-10-04T08:41:04+02:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/les-grandes-diff%C3%A9rences-entre-la-france-langleterre-le-pays-de-galles-lecosse-et-lirlande/","title":"Les Grandes Différences Entre La France, l'Angleterre, Le Pays De Galles, l'Ecosse Et l'Irlande"},{"content":"How to Convert a Music Sheet to a Mandolin Tab Hey there ! Learning the Mando, wanted to start easy with tabs, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any for the song I wanted, so I created it. And now that I know how to do it, you might learn how to do it as well.\nI decline all responsibility if you end up using tools for downloading content your don\u0026rsquo;t own. The purpose of this guide is to help you import and convert a music sheet that you currently have, even thought I discuss briefly how to get some.\nWell, so I got a Mandolin and decided that Maiden Voyage OST from Sea Of Thieves was a good starter. Found a reddit post with some tabs, but I found it lacked some notes. My opinion is worth nothing anyway, but I ended up on this score on MuseScore.\nBut hey, MuseScore is paid now for downloading scores, and it is using a Baryton, not a mando ! Well, no worries, I got everything worked out.\nFirst, download MuseScore without Muse Hub. Install it. Edit : You need to download version 3.2.3 in a .msi file on Windows. That is, if you need Android to work properly, as of 2023-09-07, only scores created on 3.2.3 are readable on Android. More informations here.\nThen, it isn\u0026rsquo;t the scope of this guide, but you will need to gather a music sheet of the song you want to learn. This can be found on the internet, on MuseScore or you might need to use libre-score. Either way, you end up with a midi or pdf file and you\u0026rsquo;ll use it on MuseScore app that you previously installed.\nEither import the PDF or open the midi file. This is done using the File menu, top left.\nThen, delete the instruments that you don\u0026rsquo;t need in the instrument tab on the left panel.\nAdd an instrument, a mandolin. You might need to search for it as it is not found under a category. You can also enter the instrument panel using i shortcut.\nNow click on the triangle on the left of the Mandolin, that\u0026rsquo;ll open the staves. Right click the default one and select Create Linked Stave. Then use the gear box of the newly created stave, and use Tab 4 str full.\nYou now should have a line with the music sheet you imported using the instrument it had, a music sheet for the mandolin and one for the mandolin tabs.\nHow to copy them to your mandolin stave ? You\u0026rsquo;ll click on the beginning of your former instrument stave, then use CTRL+SHIFT+END to select all the notes of that instrument, adn copy them using CTRL+V. Then you can paste it on your mandolin music sheet by clicking on the first case and using CTRL+V.\nIt will automatically convert to a mandolin tab. But the notes might not have the right key/pitch. If you still have all the mandolin notes selected, simply use the UP or DOWN key to adjust to the wanted key. Honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what would be standard for a Mandolin, feel free to help me out and I\u0026rsquo;ll make a correction. I used my ear and found the good one.\nYou can finally save your sheet and use it on MuseScore.

You might want to check it out as well.\nCreate You Own Hugo Website Prerequisites I\u0026rsquo;ll assume that you installed Hugo following their quick-start documentation and Git on your computer, and that you know how to clone a repository from Github. If not, Google and Chat GPT are your friends here.\nCreate Your Website Repository on Github First thing you need to do is to create your website repository on Github.\nName it website_name.github.io with website_name being your desired website name. (Thanks captain obvious).\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to tick the Add a README file. It will prevent cloning an empty repository that will lead to issues if you\u0026rsquo;re not comfortable with Git.\nCreate Your Website on Local You\u0026rsquo;ll now head to a folder of your choice on your computer.\nI\u0026rsquo;m simply using my documents folder inside my home in Ubuntu. But you might use Documents in Windows or anything else.\nOpen a command prompt inside this folder. Using Windows Terminal you should be able to right click inside the Documents folder and select Open in terminal. Or use the cd command to navigate to the right folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re a Linux user, I\u0026rsquo;ll assume that you know what you are doing.\nInput the following command :\n1 hugo new site website_name Then to get inside the newly created website folder :\n1 cd website_name And you\u0026rsquo;ll now add your Hugo website template as a git submodule.\n1 git submodule add https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/ themes/hugo-theme-stack There\u0026rsquo;s other ways of installing a theme, I just made a choice :\nUsing the theme quick-start → Usually end up being hard to configure Using a simple git clone instead of a submodule → It\u0026rsquo;ll be a pain to update the theme Using a Hugo module → Configuration involves creating folder, I\u0026rsquo;m a lazy ass, I\u0026rsquo;m configuring my theme directly from my theme folder. By the way, if you want to be able to modify the theme, you should fork the theme, and update the .gitmodules file with your forked repository link. If not, just keep it this way with the official hugo-theme-stack repository.\nIf you do choose to use the git submodules for being able to modify the website theme, please don\u0026rsquo;t forget to use the git submodule update --remote command to gather the changes from your remote fork.\nAnyway, now you should find the hugo.toml file and delete it. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, we\u0026rsquo;ll use the theme configuration file.\nSpeaking of which, copy the whole exampleSite folder content at the root of your website_name folder.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll now have a config.yaml configured correctly, meaning with the good theme and all the base configs. You can also steal mine. I don\u0026rsquo;t really mind, if anything, it\u0026rsquo;ll make me happy to see websites created thanks to my guide.\nJust don\u0026rsquo;t forget to change at least the baseurl to https://website_name.github.io/ and your website title.\nPlease make sure to add the following two lines to your config.yaml as well :\n1 2 3 # Error handling configuration for internal markdown link not found refLinksErrorLevel: WARNING refLinksNotFoundURL: https://website_name.github.io/404 They will assure that your website still build even if you push a note that has a link to an un-uploaded note, and redirect to your 404 page if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t find the requested URL.\nIcons and avatar are saved inside the assets folder. Except for your website favicon that goes into the static folder.\nYou will now come back to your Documents folder and git clone your previously created repository. You now have a website_name folder containing your Hugo site folder with the theme as a git submodule. And a website_name.github.io folder containing a README.md file.\nYou just need to copy the website_name folder content inside your repository folder named website_name.github.io. And finally, commit and push !\nConfiguring the Github Pages Online Part First, you need to go to your website settings and configure how the site is build.\nThen create a .github folder.\nInside the folder, create a workflows folder.\nFinally, create a deploy.yml file. Add the following content :\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 name: Deploy to Github Pages on: push: branches: [main] pull_request: branches: [main] jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest permissions: # Give the default GITHUB_TOKEN write permission to commit and push the # added or changed files to the repository. contents: write steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: submodules: \u0026#39;recursive\u0026#39; - name: Cache Hugo resources uses: actions/cache@v2 env: cache-name: cache-hugo-resources with: path: resources key: ${{ env.cache-name }} - uses: actions/setup-go@v2 with: go-version: \u0026#34;^1.17.0\u0026#34; - run: go version - name: Cache Go Modules uses: actions/cache@v2 with: path: | ~/.cache/go-build ~/go/pkg/mod key: ${{ runner.os }}-go-${{ hashFiles(\u0026#39;**/go.sum\u0026#39;) }} restore-keys: | ${{ runner.os }}-go- - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#34;latest\u0026#34; extended: true - name: Build run: hugo --minify --gc - name: Deploy 🚀 uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4 with: branch: gh-pages folder: public clean: true single-commit: true It is based on the hugo-stack-theme-starter repository, but configured to use a git submodule by adding the lines 20 and 21 :\n1 2 with: submodules: \u0026#39;recursive\u0026#39; If you don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Github workflows, just keep in mind that this is the part that will automatically build your site from your main branch on Github and deploy the gh-pages branch that is the built website.\nConfigure Your Website I honestly don\u0026rsquo;t have the time nor the will to document every modification I made on my website.

It will use some regex to convert wikilinks to standard Hugo links, commit and push to the relevant repository on Github, make a pull request that\u0026rsquo;ll be automatically accepted, and then use some Github Actions to build your website.\nAttachments are automatically sent as well as linked notes as long as they have the share boolean set to true as well.\nThe posts will be sent to the content/post folder and the attachments to the content/images folder.\n","date":"2023-08-02T18:55:32+02:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/obsidian-publish-alternative-how-to-one-click-upload-your-notes-on-your-own-website/","title":"Obsidian Publish Alternative, How to One-click Upload Your Notes on Your Own Website"},{"content":"Why Using Obsidian for Life Management This post is an extension of my main post showcase of my Obsidian workflow. You might want to check it out as well.\nWhat is GTD ? If you already know all of that, skip this section.\nGetting Things Done is a book written by David Allen. I recommend reading it, really. Like everything, reading key concepts online is good, but a whole book gives you a much better understanding of the underlying concepts described, why and how it works. I know it might sound like a lot of time, but it\u0026rsquo;s all worth it, trust me.\nBut if you still don\u0026rsquo;t have the time or the willingness to read GTD, try at least to read Todoist\u0026rsquo;s guide or my personal interpretation below.\nDefinitions A task is a clear action step, something to be done. It must be precise and concrete.\nA one-off task is a task that is enough by itself. Like \u0026ldquo;Calling the dentist to make an appointment\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Doing the dishes\u0026rdquo;.\nA project is a bunch of tasks to achieve a goal. It must have a due date, at least one that you tell yourself.\nKey Concepts GTD is all about capturing every thoughts you have, clarifying them, organizing them, and acting on them. Your brain should be a factory for new ideas, not a warehouse.\nSo you need an inbox, easily and quickly accessible everywhere to clear your head. We\u0026rsquo;ll use Todoist and the obsidian-todoist-plugin for that, but more on that latter. Every-time something (small or big) crosses your mind, you capture (step 1) it in here. It might be \u0026ldquo;clean the house\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;learn to play piano\u0026rdquo;, anything really.\nThen you need to clarify (step 2) these items you\u0026rsquo;ve captured. For instance :\nA task must be a clear and concrete action step (\u0026ldquo;laundry\u0026rdquo; ❌ → \u0026ldquo;Do the laundry at the laundrette\u0026rdquo; ✅). A project must be a goal to achieve (use the SMART goal setting). A reference material might be a note, a link, or a document to store that might help achieving some tasks. Or you might just need to store it for later unknown purpose. Be careful not to fall in the collector fallacy trying to store and remember everything as if Wikipedia didn\u0026rsquo;t yet exist. You then organise (step 3) them :\nA task might be delegated or waiting for something, it might be the next action of a project, it might have to wait for a start date, be scheduled for a particular day, have a due date, etc. A project must have a due date, we need time constraint because it helps us see how much we have to do and not put too much on our plate. If there\u0026rsquo;s no due date, it goes into the someday maybe list of things you\u0026rsquo;d do one day. A reference material must be filled accordingly. If it\u0026rsquo;s a piece of information you can create a note, if it\u0026rsquo;s a document you might use your cloud storage, if it\u0026rsquo;s a link you might save it using Omnivore. Tasks in obsidian-tasks vault have different properties, and are displayed by urgency using the default sorting. In short, you have to worry about these one using my template :\nHappens date : A due date : Date by which the task needs to be completed. A scheduled date : Date on which you plan to work on your task A start date : Date by which you can start working on a specific task. Possibly because you can\u0026rsquo;t do that task before this date. Context tag : A tag describing in which context you can do this task. This can be something like \u0026ldquo;phone\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;online\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;errands\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;mail\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;transports\u0026rdquo;, etc. Time available : Not used actively in this vault but might take the form of a tags as well. Energy available : Used in this vault but in the form of a tags just like contexts. Priority : Task property from obsidian-task plugin. You must review (step 4) your system periodically. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m using daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly notes. But more on that later as well, just remember that this is a really important part of the process and helps maintaining it.\nFinally, you need to engage (step 5) → It\u0026rsquo;s about time to get things done don\u0026rsquo;t you think ? That\u0026rsquo;s the fifth part.\nHorizons of Focus In GTD, there\u0026rsquo;s multiple horizons of focus :\nTasks : Actions to take Projects : A bigger task with two or more sub-tasks Areas of focus/responsibility : Areas of your life with a standard to maintain Goals \u0026amp; Objectives : Short term goals for this or next year (1-2 years) Visions : How and where do you see yourself in a few years (3-5 years) Purpose and principles : Who you are, what is your purpose and on what principles do you live I learned that having goals alongside projects didn\u0026rsquo;t work for me as I would put goals somewhere but never act on it. That\u0026rsquo;s why on this system inside obsidian, projects are goals, they live inside areas of my life.\nIf I have a goal to become an artist, I might have a daily recurring task inside that would be \u0026ldquo;Draw for 15min each day\u0026rdquo;. Or if I want to have a nice party next weekend as a goal, I might need to contact friends, prepare my shopping list, take friday off, etc.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t just put on simple goals on a list and hope that your actions will go toward them. It won\u0026rsquo;t. But if you create a goal inside one of your areas file, that links to a project note where you can put next actions and notes, you\u0026rsquo;ll move forward and clear that goal before the estimated due date !\nSo in our case with this Obsidian setup :\nTasks : They can be created simply by using markdown tasks formatting anywhere on your vault except the _Sources folder, the -Workout-Log folder, the 4-Archives folder, the 5-Templates folder and the Media Backlog note. The obsidian-tasks is configured to exclude these folders by design choice. Projects : They live inside the 1-Projects folder. One note by goals or objectives, and inside the note you can put the tasks alongside notes and embedded attachments, just like you would with a piece of paper. Areas : Areas contains projects. That\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;re creating your projects in the form of obsidian tasks. You can use wikilinks to create the project note while doing so. You can also have some recurring tasks to maintain the area standard. And finally there\u0026rsquo;s an archive to clear the clutter using obsidian-tasks-archiver plugin. Visions, purpose and principles : They are less actionable and don\u0026rsquo;t require constant consideration. Just update the note every once in a while when you feel like your long term goals have changed after a big event in your life. Don\u0026rsquo;t change them often, focus on achieving tasks to progress in your goals instead. How to Use This Vault Template for Life Management Inbox Alright, so if we want to have a GTD setup, first we need an Inbox. And those of you who already had an obsidian vault with some plugins might have spotted an important issue : Obsidian is slow to launch.\nWell, fortunately there\u0026rsquo;s a Todoist plugin for obsidian that gather tasks from your Todoist account. You can now quickly jot notes and tasks on your phone and computer directly inside Todoist\u0026rsquo;s inbox using shortcuts and see them inside the 0-Inbox file inside the 0-Inbox folder, or inside your daily-notes !\nWhy Using a Daily and Periodic Notes Instead of a Beautiful and Perfect Dashboard ? I used Notion, Notion users love clean dashboard. Obsidian folks love them too. Why I hate them ? I\u0026rsquo;m a perfectionist with many OCD1 issues. If I\u0026rsquo;m using a Dashboard, I\u0026rsquo;ll need to update it every time I feel like it (often), and end up spending more time fine tuning a board and maintaining it than acting on my life.\nUsing Daily and Periodic Notes allows you to use template, modify these templates if needed but without needing backward modifications everywhere.\nEmbrace the fact that you can change along your life journey.\nIt also provides an easy way to zoom in or zoom out to get the big picture. For instance, during a stressed period one might only rely on the daily notes and the current most important project. And as things calm down, you might consider seeing weekly, then monthly, eventually quarterly and finally yearly notes for projects plans and move their due date before to work on them.\nI spoke about reviewing your system periodically before. I used to have some \u0026ldquo;periodic\u0026rdquo; checklist to do every periods. I ended that as it became a habit to sort pictures daily, budget weekly, clean files monthly, backup quarterly and yearly. But you might also use these notes template with tasks to do at the beginning or end of each period. Even if you don\u0026rsquo;t, having periodic notes \u0026ldquo;forces\u0026rdquo; you to review where you are by zooming in and out of your day to day activities.\nYou also get a cool archive of tasks and projects achieved, and that\u0026rsquo;s great !\nThe Daily Note The daily note is the note you\u0026rsquo;ll open each morning when you wake up and each evening when you finish your working day.\nThe first part looks like this :\nThe name of the note is the current date in the ISO 8601 format. You also get the weekday, and some navigation to the periodic notes where the day belongs to and to the previous and next day.\nYou also have some shortcut to you Dashboard 🗺️ and Taskboard ✅ files, they helps you not to miss a project or a task respectively inside your vault. More on that later.\nThen there\u0026rsquo;s some introductions callouts :\nOngoing medias from your Media Backlog → Dataview script that show the medias inside columns containing the word Doing. Time left in each periods → Using a dataviewjs function based on the one provided to me by Dovos from the Dataview discord following an obsidian post. Google calendar weekly view → Using obsidian-google-calendar plugin to show a weekly view of your google calendar. Tasks Calendar using obsidian-tasks-calendar plugin based on obsidian-tasks and obsidian-dataview plugins. Ongoing and upcoming projects from your areas files inside 2-Areas folder. There\u0026rsquo;s also a notes space where you can create some one-off tasks while clarifying the Todoist inbox that sits just below.\nThe second part is all about tasks :\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just a simple set of callout containing tasks queries :\nOverdue tasks Tasks due today Upcoming tasks in the next 30 days Next actions grouped by context tags Waiting for tasks Delegated tasks You finally get to the journaling part :\nThis part contains :\nA task log for tasks done today Your workout log scanning for daily workouts Your recurring tasks And finally : Your journal ! Evaluate your mood (1-5), give a title to your day, write down your thoughts, be grateful, and write down the good things you brought to this world.\nThe Periodic Notes Basically a periodic note look like this :\nYou will get for each periodic view some slightly different templates :\nThe time left callout A google calendar weekly view if on a weekly note, or schedule view if on a monthly note A task calendar with a weekly or monthly view depending on the note type Your projects happening during this time period The projects you achieved during this time period A task log (only if on a weekly note) A journal entry How Not to Miss a Task or Project Inside My Vault ? The TaskBoard ✅ and Dashboard 🗺️ files will find any unplanned task or project inside your vault, as long as they are not inside any of the excluded files and folders :\n1 2 3 4 5 path does not include Archives path does not include Templates path does not include Workout_Log path does not include Media Backlog path does not include _Sources The Someday Maybe Note The Someday Maybe 💭 file is where you put your future goals and objectives in the form of a simple bullet list. Nothing fancy, we don\u0026rsquo;t care it\u0026rsquo;s not important as of now. But you might want to put things you want to do here, wait for a bit and decide if they\u0026rsquo;re still relevant after a while. If yes, simply create a project and start working on it !\nHow to Use Other Functionalities Such as Journaling, Workout-logging, Media-tracking ? I\u0026rsquo;ll refer you to the main post that showcase my workflow. It is detailed enough in here.\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2023-07-29T22:31:22+02:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/why-using-obsidian-for-life-management/","title":"Why Using Obsidian for Life Management"},{"content":"My Complete Obsidian Workflow to Manage My Life Introduction Why Writing This Guide ? As I promised to quite a few people on different places, I\u0026rsquo;m releasing a full blown guide of my Obsidian workflow. It has many cool features that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen people struggling with online :\nTasks and project management with journaling, workout logging and media tracking. Using daily and periodic notes. Read-it-later with automated conversion to markdown and import inside your vault. Meaning all your past knowledge is inside Obsidian, available with a simple search alongside your notes. Fast and simple one click upload obsidian publish alternative. But there\u0026rsquo;s plenty more. It took me some time here and there during the past year to come up with this setup. And don\u0026rsquo;t worry, it is easy to use despite its awfully long name. But I\u0026rsquo;ll describe it with as much depth as I can for people who wants to fine tune it.\nObviously, it is merely just a starting point, with Obsidian you can (and you always should) do something that works well for you. And that means creating your own setup. But that doesn\u0026rsquo;t forbid you from using this one as a starting-point.\nWhy is it the Perfect Obsidian Setup (at Least for me) ? It embraces many relevant and high level productivity concepts alongside Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s powerful note linking feature while still being usable as a simple \u0026ldquo;I create a simple daily checklist with a few notes\u0026rdquo; in case of existential crisis. → That means the system will last.\nOf course using Obsidian also mean offline access and data possession. You can sync your data yourself using obsidian-git plugin. If the mobile (android) version doesn\u0026rsquo;t work the way you want despite the plugin active development, you can follow one of my guides :\nOne using cron jobs to sync at regular intervals Another one that sync at Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s app startup Or just pay for the encrypted obsidian-sync official plugin.\nCore Features 🎨 Beautiful design using AnuPpuccin: Personal theme for Obsidian. 🗃️ P.A.R.A1 folder organisation based on file actionability. ✅ GTD2 task management on par with a full Todoist setup, but with a simple and natural way of writing tasks alongside notes. You also get to keep your project tasks, notes and files archives when you finish a project, allowing you to access these informations in the future. 📅 Daily notes for task management, periodic notes for projects management (week, month, quarter and year). 📓 Journal section for each daily and periodic notes to write about anything that happened during a certain period of time. 💪 Simple workout log for storing your workout sessions but with an infinite possible personalized exercise library. 🎮 Media backlog Kanban board for tracking books, shows, movies or video games backlog, consuming media at the right pace, and archiving what you do. All without proprietary online services that hold you data. 🔗 Read-it-later / bookmark manager with automated markdown conversion for offline storage inside your vault using Omnivore app. That means easy search for knowledge inside your vault across sources and personal notes. 📝 Zettelkasten note-taking on a flat structure inside 3-Resources folder. 📎 Import sources automatically using obsidian-omnivore plugin for an automatic markdown conversion of a webpage or document online or manually from a file or using markdownload. Highlight and take reference notes using Omnivore app or directly inside your vault using a simple markdown file. Write literature notes to summarise the source informations. Write permanent notes from key concepts directly inside literature notes using wiki-links. 🌐 One click upload of file and attachments to a Hugo website hosted on Github Pages thanks to obsidian-github-publisher plugin. Requirements Obsidian app. Todoist account for an easy, fast and accessible inbox on any of your devices. Omnivore account for read-it-later and bookmark manager with automated markdown conversion for offline use. Github account for hosting your website on github pages. Google account for importing your Google calendar inside your daily-notes. Quick-start : How Do I ? Repository Alright, I\u0026rsquo;m in, how can I start ?\n→ Here you can find a Github repository with an example vault using my setup. All the plugins are configured to match with one another.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to login to the following plugins using your account :\nobsidian-todoist-plugin with your todoist axcount obsidian-google-calendar plugin with your Google account obsidian-omnivore plugin with your Omnivore account obsidian-github-publisher plugin with your GitHub account For the note-sharing part, you might want to take a look at my guide, along with my own website repository and how is it configured. It is based on hugo-theme-stack.\nI will briefly explain each functionality here as well, and with more details in other posts.\nWait ! Don\u0026rsquo;t Go Further ! I forgot something in the initial post. Here\u0026rsquo;s an update. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of quality of live improvements in this vault, here\u0026rsquo;s a few examples :\nIf you hit ctrl+S or just save the file, Obsidian will lint the file ! Meaning the whole writing, the frontmatter, the titles, the spacings, even the characters used for bold or italics will be standardized. In a way that works with my other plugins ! If you paste a link, the link will auto-fetch a title for markdown link ! If you paste an image, it\u0026rsquo;ll automatically prompt you for an image title after a timestamp. That way, if you use clear unused image, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see if you deleted unwanted images or not. The first header will automatically mimic the note title. And if you lint the file, the title metadata will change according to the title as well. There\u0026rsquo;s also improvements in the way footnotes are managed along with a configurable shortcut to create footnotes automatically numbered. I recommend setting ctrl + shift + ^. How Do I Use the Tasks and Projects ? I\u0026rsquo;ll explain here how to use it. But if you want to understand why I built it this way, I encourage you to read my explanations here.\nBasically you can create tasks everywhere except inside the following files and folders :\n1 2 3 4 5 path does not include Archives path does not include Templates path does not include Workout_Log path does not include Media Backlog path does not include _Sources There\u0026rsquo;s a predefined space inside your daily note to add some one-off tasks, it is below the Notes 📝 header. But you can use tasks alongside your notes anywhere else as long as it isn\u0026rsquo;t in one of the previously mentioned files or folder.\nThe workflow also involves using projects to achieve goals \u0026amp; objectives. Each goal or objective then must have a project with an according happens date for viewing purposes.\nBut where do I create such projects to achieves my goals \u0026amp; objectives? Inside an Area file (eg: Finances) under your 2-Areas folder. Areas are to be understood as areas of focus (GTD) or areas or responsibility (P.A.R.A), meaning areas of your life.\nEach Areas file template has a Projects 🎯 header. Markdown tasks inside the file are considered as Project, you can give it any task property you find useful but a deadline is important to use the setup properly. The task description can then be enclosed by [[ in order to create a wikilink to a project note inside the 1-Projects folder. You\u0026rsquo;ll find more informations about wikilinks in the obsidian documentation.\nIf you feel the need to use a recurring task like \u0026ldquo;Add recent transactions to my budget each week\u0026rdquo; inside your Finances area to maintain a standard, you might create a project called \u0026ldquo;Maintain a good budget\u0026rdquo;. Inside the project note, you can create a recurring task and that\u0026rsquo;s it. I would always recommend setting a happens date as it will help you see if it became a habit by then.\nBut how to display my current tasks ? That\u0026rsquo;s the job of the daily note. It will display tasks according to their happens date, and it will also display the tasks that has one of the three specific tags (that can\u0026rsquo;t be used at the same time by essence) : #next, #waiting and #delegated. They are displayed differently and tasks using the #next tag will be grouped by context, meaning by their other tag(s).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also the TaskBoard ✅ note where you\u0026rsquo;ll find unplanned tasks (without happens date or tags) so that you can\u0026rsquo;t miss a thing ! You should open this note sometimes to make sure nothing is left unattended.\nIn order to show which project you should be working on, you should rely on your periodic notes (weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly) to display the relative projects based on their first happen date. The Dashboard 🗺️ plays a similar role. There\u0026rsquo;s also a callout inside the daily note that queries upcoming projects (with a happens date in the next 30 days) and the projects in progress (using - [/] tasks status).\nThe Someday Maybe 💭 file is where you put your future goals and objectives in the form of a simple bullet list. Nothing fancy, we don\u0026rsquo;t care it\u0026rsquo;s not important as of now. But you might want to put things you want to do here, wait for a bit and decide if they\u0026rsquo;re still relevant after a while. If yes, simply create a project and start working on it !\nThe higher horizons of existence are covered in the Vision, Identity, Purpose \u0026amp; Principles ⚙️ note.\nBasically :\nVisions : Where and how you see yourself in 3-5 years. Identity : Who you are. Purpose : Your ultimate goal in life, why you\u0026rsquo;re in this world. Principles : Values you act upon everyday. How Do I Use the Journal ? You can write your feelings inside your daily note and each periodic notes, that\u0026rsquo;s always the last header purpose.\nThe daily note adds a grateful part in which you should describe the good things that happened each day, and the things you did that were good to the world.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a mood tracking property (mood:1-5) that ranges from 1=bad to 5=amazing. It could be used with the obsidian-tracker plugin to create a mood chart, but I have no use for it yet myself.\nI created a Journal 📓 note with a script that queries every single journal entries from your daily notes. Basically, it finds any header containing the word \u0026ldquo;Journal\u0026rdquo;, take the content, and stop at the next header found or the end of the note. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for the last time you had \u0026ldquo;fun\u0026rdquo;, just ctrl+f inside this note in read view and you\u0026rsquo;ll find it.\nIf you need to import your journal from Daylio like me, you might want to take a look at obsidian-daylio-parser repository on Github, or my fork of it that works well with my example vault.\nHow Do I Use the Workout Log ? If you right click on the -Workout-Log folder and select Create new note from template, you can select your workout template. It will be correctly named with a YYYY-MM-DD_ timestamp and will then be found inside the Workout Log 💪 callout of your daily note. Nothing fancy, just enough for keeping count.\nIt is important that the first header of your workout template keep the templater code snippet. This is how the timestamp is added to the template file name.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll find that I added goals to sections of my workout linked to goals in my Sport area. You can do something like this, or not. Experiment with queries and filters from the dataview plugin or the task plugin, you can make very powerful things without much effort. You just need to read their doc !\nTake extra care where moving file from the 5-Templates folder to the archives or anywhere else. You should remove the templater code from everywhere before doing so, otherwise it might end up in an infinite loop of template file creation because of filename-heading-sync and templater plugin working asynchronously.\nHow Do I Use the Media Backlog ? Your Media Backlog 🎮 file is a simple Kanban board. It is self explicit, just keep in mind that the daily note\u0026rsquo;s Ongoing Medias 🎮 callout will query some kanban cards. But only the one inside columns that contains Doing. That\u0026rsquo;ll help you to know what you could be doing during your daily spare time today.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s some predefined tags with emojis that you can find in the colorful-tag plugin settings.\nIf you finished something, you can add a date on the kanban board by using the Add a date command from right clicking the card.\nYou might want to add the #ongoing tag if there\u0026rsquo;s going to be a sequel and you want to get back to it later on.\nHow Do I Use the The Read-it-later and Bookmark Manager ? This part is pretty simple. You simply need to connect your Omnivore account, add some pages to your inbox. It will then be synced to Obsidian inside the _Sources folder each time you use the Omnivore button on Obsidian left side bar. It has been configured to import inside a different daily folder based on when you saved the link. The generated markdown file will contains the document notes from Omnivore, then your highlight and content notes, and finally the whole converted markdown page. Simple as that !\nIt allows you to simply search inside Obsidian if you want to find past knowledge you came across. That\u0026rsquo;s why I love it.\nI wont describe too much functionalities here as the app and plugin are in active development. I\u0026rsquo;ll let you discover the magic with their documentation.\nHow Do I Use The Note Sharing Process ? The whole process is detailed in another post.\nThe note sharing process requires to create a Hugo website first on Github Pages. Once it\u0026rsquo;s done, you can simply change the share boolean to true in the note frontmatter, then select the command Upload filename to DEFAULT of the obsidian-github-publisher plugin from the note drop down menu. It will use some regex to convert wikilinks to standard Hugo links formatting, commit and push to the relevant repository on Github, make a pull request that\u0026rsquo;ll be automatically accepted (allowing for easy reversing changes), and then use some Github Actions to build your website.\nAttachments are automatically sent as well as linked notes as long as they have the share boolean set to true as well.\nThe posts will be sent to the content/post folder and the attachments to the content/images folder.\nDetailed Explanations Links Why Using Obsidian for Life Management Obsidian Publish Alternative, How to One-click Upload Your Notes on Your Own Website How is the Vault Organised ? This setup relies heavily on Obsidian wikilinks and tags for task and project management, but also for attachment cleaning. One should take the habit to use them.\n_Media folder : Storing all attachments (images and pdf for example) in the same folder using the YYYY-MM-DD_filename.extension pattern thanks to obsidian-paste-image-rename. Beware, all the attachments must be linked inside a note, otherwise the use of plugins such as Find orphaned files and broken links and Clean unused images might delete them. _Sources folder : Storing all the websites sources you saved automatically using Omnivore or manually using markdownload. -Daily-Notes folder : Storing daily notes for tasks management, quick-notes and journaling. -Periodic-Notes folder : Storing weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly notes for project management and journaling. -Workout_Log folder : Storing your workout logs. 0-Inbox folder : Newly created files automatically goes here. However, using the file explorer on the left you can create note wherever you want. 1-Projects folder : Project files containing markdown notes, tasks, embedded attachments (attachments are still stored inside the _Media folder, but you can embed them inside projet notes), wikilinks to useful notes or whatever you need to complete your projects. That\u0026rsquo;s the real power of Obsidian, you can organise projects naturally, just like you would do using a piece of paper. 2-Areas folder : Containing main areas of responsibility of your life files. That\u0026rsquo;s in these files that you\u0026rsquo;ll create projects in the form of tasks with a wikilink to a project note. 3-Resources folder : Contains all of your notes and stuff ! 4-Archives folder : Contains done or cancelled projects, no longer relevant and old resources that you might never need again… But you might also need once again, so you archive it instead of deleting it. 5-Templates folder : Contains all your file templates used by the templater plugin. Vision, Purpose and Principles ⚙️ file : Contains your visions (3-5 year goals), who you are, what is your purpose in life and what are your principles. Taskboard ✅ file : Useful to scan for unplanned tasks across your vault. Someday Maybe 💭 file : Write someday maybe projects, things to do one day and goals you\u0026rsquo;d like to achieve.

I\u0026rsquo;m just stating the pros and cons of each of the three options on the title, because they basically have almost the same tools.\nWave+ Pros Rounder finish, helps to get a better hold and apply more force to the pliers. Charge+ Pros Over the Wave+ Better knife blade (154CM steel instead of 420HC one) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-pGckfXhWk for more information). Gut hook on the serrated blade, useful to cut strings in a safer way and for butchering an animal. Classy finish with handgrips. Might be harder to put pressure on it, but better grip and finish. Pocket clip is sold with the Charge+. The molle sheath has two pockets for lights and or pens, the wave doesn\u0026rsquo;t have additional pockets. Partial bit kit is added with the most useful bits (https://www.knivesandtools.fr/fr/pt/-leatherman-charge-plus-pince-multifonction-etui-en-nylon.htm). Cons Over the Wave+ The crimper might be harder to use because the protections around the tool are heavier and bulkier, hence you\u0026rsquo;ll triple crimp sometimes. Bulkier. Like he really feels bigger. Charge+ TTI Pros Over the Charge+ Lighter (really small difference). Premium finish. Better knife blade (S30V steel instead of 154CM one) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-pGckfXhWk for more information). Small upgrade over the 154CM one, while the 420HC is last by far (3 to 4 times worse edge retention). Cons Over the Charge+ The plier might break easily because of the additional crimper on it. At least many people said that. Conclusion Basically, each one is an upgrade from the other one. But these upgrades are not useful for everyone and should be considered as the price increase is quite huge.\nI ended up buying a Wave+ because I don\u0026rsquo;t need the hook, I needed the full bit kit anyway, I have a tactical pouch where I\u0026rsquo;ll put it so I don\u0026rsquo;t need the sheath, and if the blade isn\u0026rsquo;t as good as the others to cut through ropes and card boxes, I\u0026rsquo;ll use the serrated blade anyway so it is not a problem.\nIn addition, I recommend buying a Work Sharp Guided Field Sharpener for sharpening your leatherman : https://www.worksharptools.com/shop/benchtop/manual/guided-field-sharpener/\nHave a nice day, hope it helps !\n","date":"2023-02-22T14:25:33+01:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/leatherman-wave-charge-and-charge-tti-comparison/","title":"Leatherman Wave+, Charge+ and Charge+ TTI Comparison"},{"content":"How to Use Obsidian Git Sync on Android Inspirations My old guide using cron jobs with time intervals instead of tasker How to sync your obsidian vault on mobile using git Mobile Sync for Obsidian | Some Thoughts Automatically sync notes to and from git repository whenever you open and close Obsidian on mobile. · GitHub Obsidian Syncing Alternative (For Android and iOS) | Obsidian-Sync-Alternative Install the Required Tools Install Tasker from the official website (7 days trial) or from the Google Play Store (~3.5€).\nInstall Termux, Termux Widget, Termux Tasker on F-droid or on the official Termux Github repository.\n[!attention] Never use the play store version Trust me it is depreciated.\nGive Termux access to your storage using the following command :\n1 termux-setup-storage Setup Git and Github for Manipulating Repositories Use the following commands to setup git and github via HTTPS :\n1 pkg update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; pkg upgrade 1 pkg install git 1 pkg install gh You can use SSH or an access token as well instead of using gh\nLogin to your Github account :\n1 gh auth login Update the git configs :\n1 git config --global user.name \u0026#34;name\u0026#34; 1 git config --global user.email \u0026#34;email\u0026#34; Go into the shared folder :\n1 cd ~/storage/shared/ Clone your repo :\n1 git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GH_USERNAME/Lifewiki.git Try using the following commands :\n1 2 3 4 git status git pull git commit git push [!Attention] Android 12 warning If you are on Android 12, you\u0026rsquo;ll get an error with the command required to add the repository to a security list or something like that. Do it, and these commands should work.\nChange the Default Termux Working Directory Edit the bashrc file :\n1 nano /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc/bash.bashrc And append this line to the end of the file :\n1 cd ~/storage/shared/Lifewiki Restart your terminal, and you will find that it always opens up in your desired directory!\nSetup Tasker Launch Tasker and do the basic setup (setting battery optimisation and stuff).\n[!Done] Give Tasker some important Termux permissions Android Settings -\u0026gt; Apps -\u0026gt; Tasker -\u0026gt; Permissions -\u0026gt;Additional permissions -\u0026gt; Run commands in Termux environment.\nLaunch Termux mkdir ~/.termux/tasker/ cd ~/.termux/tasker/ nano pull.sh Add the following script : 1 2 3 #!/bin/bash git pull exit 0 nano backup.sh Add the following script : 1 2 3 4 5 #!/bin/bash git add -A git commit -a -m \u0026#34;android vault backup: `date +\u0026#39;%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S\u0026#39;`\u0026#34; git push exit 0 Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to edit permissions to termux home folder :\nchmod 700 -R /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux\nCreate an Obsidian profile :\nSetup the following task :\nSetup the Error Handling Shortcut for Merge Conflict Create a directory for the shortcuts :\n1 2 mkdir -p /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.shortcuts chmod 700 -R /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.shortcuts Create the sync script :\n1 2 cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.shortcuts nano debug.sh Add the following script :\n1 2 3 #!/bin/bash cd storage/shared/LifeWiki git reset --hard Create the widget and add it to your home screen. That\u0026rsquo;s it, you just need to launch it to solve merging errors.\nSetting up an Automatic Execution of the Script (Not Recommended if You Want to Avoid Merge issues) If you want to automatically sync your vault every hour, for instance, you can do it using a Cron job (like described in this thread or this one).\nFirst, create the auto sync task folders :\n1 2 mkdir -p /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.shortcuts/tasks chmod 700 -R /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.shortcuts/tasks Create the sync script inside .shortcut/tasks :\n1 2 3 #!/bin/bash cd storage/shared/LifeWiki git pull \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git add -A \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git commit -a -m \u0026#34;android vault backup: `date +\u0026#39;%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S\u0026#39;`\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git push [!info] Difference between .shortcuts and .shortcuts/tasks folders What is run inside .shortcuts are just scripts launching Termux. If it is run under the tasks folder, it will launch it as an underground task.\nFirst, you need to install Cron :\n1 pkg install cronie termux-services Then, you\u0026rsquo;ll restart Termux and then run the following :\n1 2 sv-enable crond crontab -e Finally, you\u0026rsquo;ll end up with the crontab -e command in the nano text editor. Add the following :\n1 0 * * * * bash ~/.shortcuts/tasks/sync_script.sh You just need to keep Termux opened in order for the job to be able to launch.\nYou can find information about Cron job easily on the internet.\nEdit : I already uploaded a guide to do it with a cron job. I kept this part, but I wanted something less energy consuming. Hence I learned how to use Tasker and did it this way. I find it as simple as the obsidian-git plugin on computer, but on mobile !

How is it independant ? We\u0026rsquo;ll make sure that GRUB (Linux Bootloader) will install itself on the Linux Drive, and won\u0026rsquo;t be on your Windows drive with Windows Bootloader. That means you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to remove any of the two drives and use them on any other machine you want.\nThe setup will work as follow :\nReferences Dual Booting Ubuntu With Windows 10 Pro With BitLocker Encryption - It\u0026rsquo;s FOSS Dual boot Windows + Linux with encryption - Super User How to encrypt a dual boot setup with two drives (SSD) - General Linux Question - It\u0026rsquo;s FOSS Community How to encrypt a dual boot setup with two drives (SSD) - Linux Mint Forums [SOLVED] Dual booting Mint on a second drive independently. - Linux Mint Forums Special thanks to AndyMH who helped me on Reddit, and kept helping me by mail and on the Linux Mint Forums. Before Doing Anything Requirement In order to follow this guide you need :\nTwo drives (SSD1 or HDD,2 it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter at all). Verify that the second drive you just installed is recognized by Windows by opening the Windows File Explorer. From now on during this guide, your C drive will be the one referenced as your Windows Drive. And your D drive as the one that will get Linux Mint.\nWindows 11 Pro Edition : Cheap keys can be bought at Cdiscount for ~1€. That also means you need a motherboard that supports TPM 2.0 in order to have Windows 11 (At least that\u0026rsquo;s what I read on the internet). Alternative path : Using VeraCrypt instead of Bitlocker as an encrypting software for the Windows side of the dual boot. I don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about it, but you might pioneer something.\nA USB Key of at least 16 gb (I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly, it just worked for me with that size). A computer that might be compatible with Linux thanks to your hardware. If you want to verify, you can check with : Linux Mint - Community : Linux Mint known compatible devices. Certified hardware | Ubuntu : Ubuntu certified devices. Ubuntu-MSI-laptops : This is an example, but there is a page for many laptop brands for instance. An internet connection might help (a lot). Backup. First, backup your computer. If you follow this guide, it could work. But it might as well fail, and you\u0026rsquo;ll thank your past-self if you have a backup.\nI am personnaly using Macrium Software | Reflect Free Edition and an eHDD (external hard drive) to create a full image backup in case things get messy. Whatever you choose to do, do a backup.\nEnable and Disable Bitlocker Encryption to Make Sure it Works Well Before doing anything, we want to make sure that Bitlocker is working properly.\nSearch on Windows for \u0026ldquo;Manage Bitlocker\u0026rdquo;. Encrypt your C Drive. Use the \u0026ldquo;Encrypt entire drive\u0026rdquo; option along with the \u0026ldquo;New encryption mode\u0026rdquo; that will use your TPM. Backup your recovery key. Print it, put it in the cloud, do whatever you want, but keep it. Be careful. Every time you\u0026rsquo;ll exit the encryption wizard, the backup key is changing. So remember to back it up again if you cancelled it to prepare yourself some spaghetti.\nLet the encryption process do its thing. Reboot and make sure it works. Now that hopefully everything works well, go back to \u0026ldquo;Manage Bitlocker\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Turn off Bitlocker\u0026rdquo;. Yes, you heard me. Do you want a safe dual boot process ? We just verified that everything works well. That\u0026rsquo;s it. Make sure to turn if off completely. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to just suspend encryption, you want to turn it off.\nEdit : As we will remove the Windows Drive (physically or by using some manipulation with Gparted), it should also work if you keep it Bitlocker encrypted. Or if it isn\u0026rsquo;t yet encrypted. They should be completely independent anyway. But I\u0026rsquo;m a crazily paranoid man, that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m putting it here.\nSetup Preparation Preparing Your Windows Setup for the Dual Boot Experience Windows has many things that could make your dual-boot setup goes wrong. That\u0026rsquo;s why we\u0026rsquo;ll make sure everything goes as smooth as possible by doing the following things :\nRemove fast-boot by going into the old alimentation settings of windows, choose actions when button pressed and remove fast boot, hibernate and (optional) sleep mode. Then, open a cmd as admin and type powercfg -h off. Search for hiberfil.sys for additional information on how to deactivate fast-boot. Remove fast boot from the Bios as well. Remove secure-boot from your Bios. Remove Intel Fast Start from Bios. I won\u0026rsquo;t be explaining much moredependentis dependent on your system. Google will be your best friend, but don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to ask for help somewhere.\nPreparing Your Linux Mint Installation Medium Follow the instructions on the Linux Mint wiki and download the .iso (Choose the right edition—Linux Mint Installation Guide documentation). Verify your ISO (integrity and authenticity : Verify your ISO image—Linux Mint Installation Guide documentation). Create the bootable media with Etcher (Create the bootable media—Linux Mint Installation Guide documentation). That\u0026rsquo;s it. You\u0026rsquo;re ready. Things are going to become interesting now.\nBeginning the Dual-boot Process Shut down your laptop. Connect your USB key to the laptop and boot. It should go on Linux live by default, if not, change your boot order in your Bios. Windows Hard-drive Disconnection In order to create a completely independent dual-boot setup, we want to disconnect the Windows Drive before doing the Linux Mint installation. If you can physically disconnect the drive, go on, do it, and skip the following Gparted part. If you\u0026rsquo;re using a laptop and/or don\u0026rsquo;t want to bother, read the following.\nRun Gparted by searching for it in the admin section of the applications. Find your Windows disk with 4 partitions (EFI, MS reserved, C:, and a recovery partition). The drive may appear as nvme0n1 and the first partition as nvme0n1p1 if this is an nVME SSD. Otherwise, in linux, the first drive in the system is sda, the next sdb and so on. The first partition on a drive would be sda1, the next sda2 and so on.\nSelect the EFI partition (fat32, size less than 500mb, and flags BOOT and ESP set). Select “manage flags”. Uncheck the BOOT and ESP flags. The partition will now appear with the msftdata flag. Close Gparted. Installing Linux Mint Launch install Mint. Follow the instructions (Install Linux Mint—Linux Mint Installation Guide documentation). But be careful, you will need to click on \u0026ldquo;Continue testing\u0026rdquo; at the end of the installation process if you chose to disconnect the Windows Drive virtually using Gparted and flags. Select \u0026ldquo;Erase disk and install Linux Mint\u0026rdquo;. Make sure there is no OS detected on the actual drive and that it is your second drive, and it will do his partitioning thing on the newly added drive. I think you can choose to use LVM and LUKS full disk encryption here. Do it. But be careful, maybe you keyboard setup is not the one you physically have. Type your password on the search bar to be sure! Choose a short computer and username. For instance, I\u0026rsquo;m using \u0026ldquo;MSI-GL75\u0026rdquo; as a computer name and my first name as my username. You\u0026rsquo;ll thank me later. Select \u0026ldquo;Require my password to log in\u0026rdquo; and tick \u0026ldquo;Encrypt my home folder\u0026rdquo;. Select \u0026ldquo;Continue testing\u0026rdquo; at the end of the installation process. Run Gparted and enable back the ESP and BOOT flags on the EFI Windows partition. Reboot and go into bios settings. Put Ubuntu at the top of the list of the boot order. You should now boot immediatelyinto Linux Mint instead Grub dual-boot menu. It is normal. Open up a terminal with ctrl+alt+ and type sudo update-grub. Grub config will be updated by finding the Windows EFI partition. Grub will now be working Now you should have a working dual-boot setup with Linux Mint encrypted. But wait a bit, we still need to encrypt Windows and change a few things.\nOh, and don\u0026rsquo;t forget to think about a backup for Linux Mint. You now have Macrium Reflect for Windows. There\u0026rsquo;s Timeshift and Backintime that can help backing up your system files and personall files respectively.\nAfter Installing Linux Mint : A Few Things to Change A Beautiful Grub Menu You want a beautiful Grub boot menu like that and not just a command line type of dual-boot screen ? Follow these instructions : Grub Boot Menu — Linux Mint User Guide documentation\nOpen a terminal, and type the following command :\n1 apt install --reinstall -o Dpkg::Options::=\u0026#34;--force-confmiss\u0026#34; grub2-theme-mint Or if you have a high-DPI screen :\n1 apt install --reinstall -o Dpkg::Options::=\u0026#34;--force-confmiss\u0026#34; grub2-theme-mint-2k Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to do a sudo update-grub afterward to update the Grub config file.\nA Grub Menu That Remembers the Last OS You Chose Self-explicit.\nI followed keepitsimpleengineer\u0026rsquo;s answer in this topic :\ngrub2 - How do I set Windows to boot as the default in the boot loader? - Ask Ubuntu.\nYou just need to open a terminal and type the following command :\n1 sudo nano -B /etc/default/grub Change the value of GRUB_DEFAULT to saved:\n1 GRUB_DEFAULT=saved Enable the SAVEDEFAULT functionality by adding the following line bellow GRUB_DEFAULT :\n1 GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true Now you have to run\n1 sudo update-grub to update the system generated grub.cfg file in the /boot/grub/ directory.\nSolve Timezone Issues When You Switch OS If you dual boot Windows and Ubuntu or any other Linux distribution, you might have noticed a time difference between the two operating systems.\nWhen you use Linux, it shows the correct time. But when you boot into Windows, it shows the wrong time. Sometimes, it is the opposite and Linux shows the wrong time and Windows has the correct time.\nThat’s strange specially because you are connected to the internet and your date and time is set to be used automatically.\nDon’t worry! You are not the only one to face this issue. You can fix it by using the following command in the Linux terminal:\n1 timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 If you want some explanations, follow this link to get the full guide :\n[Solved] Wrong Time in Windows 10 After Dual Boot With Linux\nPrepare Group Policies for Windows Encryption Allow Complexe Password and Not Just Pin Open the Group Policy Editor (type gpedit after opening the start menu) and navigate to Administrative Templates \u0026gt; Windows Components \u0026gt; Bitlocker Drive Encryption \u0026gt; Operating System Drives Enable \u0026ldquo;Allow enhanced PINS for startup\u0026rdquo; : Allows you to use a real password and not just numbers for your encryption. Add a Password at Startup You can follow Chris Hoffman\u0026rsquo;s guide entirely, as this is the one I used here :\nHow to Enable a Pre-Boot BitLocker PIN on Windows\nStep One: Enable BitLocker (If You Haven’t Already) This is a BitLocker feature, so you have to use BitLocker encryption to set a pre-boot PIN. This is only available on Professional and Enterprise editions of Windows. Before you can set a PIN, you have to enable BitLocker for your system drive.\nNote that, if you go out of your way to enable BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, you’ll be prompted to create a startup password that’s used instead of the TPM. The below steps are only necessary when enabling BitLocker on computers with TPMs, which most modern computers have.\nIf you have a Home version of Windows, you won’t be able to use BitLocker. You may have the Device Encryption feature instead, but this works differently from BitLocker and doesn’t allow you to provide a startup key.\nStep Two: Enable the Startup PIN in Group Policy Editor Once you’ve enabled BitLocker, you’ll need to go out of your way to enable a PIN with it. This requires a Group Policy settings change. To open the Group Policy Editor, press Windows+R, type “gpedit.msc” into the Run dialog, and press Enter.\nHead to Computer Configuration \u0026gt; Administrative Templates \u0026gt; Windows Components \u0026gt; BitLocker Drive Encryption \u0026gt; Operating System Drives in the Group Policy window.\nDouble-click the “Require Additional Authentication at Startup” Option in the right pane.\nSelect “Enabled” at the top of the window here. Then, click the box under “Configure TPM Startup PIN” and select the “Require Startup PIN With TPM” option. Click “OK” to save your changes.\nStep Three: Add a PIN to Your Drive You can now use the manage-bde command to add the PIN to your BitLocker-encrypted drive.\nTo do this, launch a Command Prompt window as Administrator. On Windows 10 or 8, right-click the Start button and select “Command Prompt (Admin)”. On Windows 7, find the “Command Prompt” shortcut in the Start menu, right-click it, and select “Run as Administrator”\nRun the following command. The below command works on your C: drive, so if you want to require a startup key for another drive, enter its drive letter instead of c: .\n1 manage-bde -protectors -add c: -TPMAndPIN You’ll be prompted to enter your PIN here. The next time you boot, you’ll be asked for this PIN.\nTip: If you see an error, run the gpupdate command on its own line before running the manage-bde command shown above. This will force Windows to apply your group policy changes.\nTo double-check whether the TPMAndPIN protector was added, you can run the following command:\n1 manage-bde -status (The “Numerical Password” key protector displayed here is your recovery key.)\nHow to Change Your BitLocker PIN To change the PIN in the future, open a Command Prompt window as Administrator and run the following command:\n1 manage-bde -changepin c: You’ll need to type and confirm your new PIN before continuing.\nHow to Remove the PIN Requirement If you change your mind and want to stop using the PIN later, you can undo this change.\nFirst, you’ll need to head to the Group Policy window and change the option back to “Allow Startup PIN With TPM”. You can’t leave the option set to “Require Startup PIN With TPM” or Windows won’t allow you to remove the PIN.\nNext, open a Command Prompt window as Administrator and run the following command:\n1 manage-bde -protectors -add c: -TPM This will replace the “TPMandPIN” requirement with a “TPM” requirement, deleting the PIN. Your BitLocker drive will automatically unlock via your computer’s TPM when you boot.\nTo check that this completed successfully, run the status command again:\n1 manage-bde -status c: If you forget the PIN, you’ll need to provide the BitLocker recovery code you should have saved somewhere safe when you enabled BitLocker for your system drive.\nPrevent Bitlocker From Asking for Your Recovery Code Everytime You Boot Link to the answer by ouk :\nwindows 10 - BitLocker asking for protection code after Ubuntu installation - Super User\nOpen the Group Policy Editor (type gpedit after opening the start menu) and navigate to Administrative Templates \u0026gt; Windows Components \u0026gt; Bitlocker Drive Encryption \u0026gt; Operating System Drives Enable \u0026ldquo;Configure TPM platform validation profile for native UEFI firmware configurations\u0026rdquo; : The standard configuration includes PCR 0, 2, 4, 7 and 11. You should only keep 0, 2 and 11. PCR 7 is disabled when Secure Boot is. PCR 4 should be disabled to allow Grub to work properly with the GRUB_DEFAULT=saved feature enabled. Activate Bitlocker Just turn on Bitlocker like before on your Windows drive, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to save the recovery key because it will change, and that\u0026rsquo;s it, you\u0026rsquo;ve done it.\nYou can now be a proud encrypted dual-boot user.

Nous avons ainsi joué notamment sur les dimensions des roues, du système 3 roues, la hauteur du chariot et son chargement afin de contrôler l\u0026rsquo;assistance quel que soit le niveau de charge.\nCes études nous ont mené a définir notre cahier des charges techniques :\nCharge max admissible : 30kg Contenance maximale : 50L Poids à vide : 5 à 10kg max Diamètre roues : 14cm Entraxe système 3 roues : 17cm Hauteur du chariot : 1.1m Largeur du chariot : 40cm Profondeur du chariot : 35cm En terme de composants utilisés :\nMoteur : Transtecno CM 026 F30 D, série CM-CMP Couple en sortie de 10 Nm (entre 1 et 17) Puissance 0.06 kW à 0.12 kW Vitesse entre 25 et 300 RPM Transmission : Réducteur intégré puis réduction par engrenage de 0.5.

Notebloc is basically Camscanner for free with amazing image quality and Google Drive Sync. 3.59€ wasn\u0026rsquo;t much, I don\u0026rsquo;t have anything else to say, it is amazing and most importantly : Fast to scan, resize and change the filter.\nSwiftscan offered good image quality while being quite slow before. Now I don\u0026rsquo;t have a good image quality since the few last updates, but I know it\u0026rsquo;s related to my phone and the support is going to help about that.\nSame quality as far as I tested it out (used it for the last 2 years) but it is slower in scanning, resizing and especially in changing filter. It might be related to my phone, but if my phone can be that fast in Notebloc, it means it should be the same for everyone as my phone is not a standard in speed.\nFinally we have GeniusScan. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to admit, I like the fact that this is a French company developping it. But I took it for his precise autocrop and his quality. But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t as good as the other two even if he was fast, but in the end we do want great filter quality and pdf quality, so I decided not to put him before.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it, if you want to make your own opinion about that, you can check the two links I dropped at the beginning of this post.\nTL : DR :\nNotebloc : Good quality and amazingly fast\nSwiftScan : Good quality but now has problems with my phones and some other, slower because of optimization andbecause of the way features are implemented\nGeniusScan : Amazingly fast with good autocrop but can\u0026rsquo;t compete with scan quality of the other two\nHave a wonderful day, stay safe everyone o/\n","date":"2021-01-05T07:41:25+01:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/the-best-android-scanner-app-for-2021-in-my-opinion/","title":"The Best Android Scanner App for 2021 in My Opinion"},{"content":"Using Daylio on Your PC Hi everyone !\nAfter asking on this sub for a PC support of Daylio in order to type long journal entries, I\u0026rsquo;m back here to help you set everything up !\nThe solution I\u0026rsquo;ve found the most simple and lightweight to use is scrcpy.

Ce qui a pour conséquence de lui procurer un viseur ajustable, une détente souple et une construction solide.\nLe « Python » a une très bonne réputation parmi les historiens et spécialistes du domaine, on l’a déjà nommé « la Rolls-Royce des revolvers Colt » ou encore « le meilleur revolver du monde ». Sa réputation est néanmoins méritée car son système de détente est très perfectionné, par exemple quand le révolver est complètement chargé, une fois que l’on appuie sur la détente le cylindre se bloque pendant que le chien percute la balle. Cela permet d’éviter que le cylindre soit lâche pendant le tir, un problème présent sur nombreux modèle de revolver.\nMotivations Le Colt « Python » est une arme que l’on connait très bien, en effet, étant tous fan de jeux vidéo et de séries nous l’avons déjà rencontré à de nombreuses reprises. Il est par exemple présent dans la série Half-Life, Resident Evil ou encore The Walking Dead. Les revolvers en général ont laissé, et laisse encore, une trace dans la culture populaire. Tout le monde connait et apprécie ce type d’arme, que ce soit pour leurs apparences uniques ou leur “aura” (en effet, on les associe directement à l’ambiance unique des Westerns).\nEn plus d’être une arme très répandue dans les jeux vidéo et en général dans la culture populaire, cette arme en particulier possède un mécanisme de tir à double action qui est très intéressant à modéliser et assez rare dans cette catégorie d’arme de poing.\nEt enfin le Colt « Python » est à nouveaux d’actualité car sa production a été relancée en janvier 2020.\nPrise D\u0026rsquo;informations Nomenclature A l’aide de documents papiers récupérés sur internet et d’un jeu nommé World Of Guns : Disassembly, nous avons pu établir la nomenclature de notre revolver :\nMécanisme De Rechargement Et De Tir Le Revolver Colt « Python » est à double action, c’est ce qui le rend intéressent. Néanmoins le fait qu’il soit un revolver lui permet d’être utilisé en simple et double action.\nAvant d’aller plus loin dans les explications, définissons ce qu’est un mécanisme à simple et double action :\nUn mécanisme simple action signifie qu’un appui sur la gâchette de l’arme ne fera qu’abaisser le chien qui ensuite percutera la cartouche. Il est donc nécessaire de relever manuellement le chien avec le pouce avant d’appuyer sur la gâchette si on veut que le coup part. Un mécanisme double action possède lui la capacité de relever automatiquement le chien. Les deux étapes (monter et abaisser le chien) se font simultanément en un appui sur la gâchette. Ce qui permet d’économiser du temps entre deux tirs. ⇒ Dans le Colt « Python » la double action fonctionne de la manière suivante :\nLorsqu’on appuie sur la gâchette, elle pivote. Ce qui élève la partie arrière de celle-ci qui va servir de poussoir au chien. Quand on pousse sur le chien, celui-ci pivote à son tour, ce qui permet au percuteur de s’éloigner du barillet. Quand la gâchette est reculée au maximum, sa partie poussoir va perdre le contact avec le chien. Le ressort de celui-ci va alors pouvoir se détendre et le percuteur va alors frapper la balle. En un mouvement sur la gâchette le mécanisme double action du revolver a donc levé et abaissé le chien pour permettre le tir.\nModélisation Planification Pour commencer la modélisation nous avons d’abord cherché des plans. N’ayant aucune documentation en ligne sur les dimensions exactes d’une arme à feu nous avons utilisé des images du colt complétement démonté. En utilisant la taille des balles de calibre .357 comme échelle pour avoir une longueur de référence nous avons pu coter les pièces sur nos plans en commençant par le barillet.\nPuis nous avons enchainé avec le corps du revolver, et enfin nous aurions pu nous attarder a y intégrer le mécanisme de tir.\nModélisation Du Barillet Nous avons commencé par modéliser le barillet pour avoir une pièce référence pour l’échelle du reste de la modélisation.\nModélisation De La Carcasse Pour la carcasse, nous l’avons faite en une seule esquisse qui est extrudée. Les dimensions exactes n’était pas très importantes autour de la crosse mais nous avons dû être précis dans le dimensionnement aux alentours des pièces qui viendront ensuite s’emboiter ou s’assembler à la partie principale de l’arme. Nous avons dû reprendre la carcasse à plusieurs reprises pour obtenir le bon alignement avec le barillet et le canon.\nModélisation Du Mécanisme Du Barillet Et Du Canon Ici l’objectif était de pouvoir faire pivoter l’intégralité du barillet sur le coté pour pouvoir recharger facilement l’arme. Il est composé de plusieurs pièces qui une fois assemblées viennent se fixer sans problème sur le corps de l’arme avec le canon.\nLe petit rebord sur la dernière figure sert mécaniquement à ce que le barillet ne descende pas complètement et reste bloqué à 90° pour le rechargement de l’arme. La tige à l’intérieur du barillet se pousse en arrière pour éjecter les douilles.\nModélisation De La Gachette Et Du Chien Nous avons voulu modéliser le chien et la gâchette de telle manière à reproduire le mécanisme double action qui lève le chien lorsque nous appuyons sur la gâchette et qui le relâche une fois arrivée en butée, par manque de ressources nous n’avons pas pu modéliser l’intégralités des pièces servant ce mécanisme. Nous n’avons pas pu non plus modéliser le ressort du retour du chien car CATIA ne permet pas facilement la réalisation de pièce avec des propriétés élastique.\nUpdate post-diplôme: Avec nos connaissances de fin d\u0026rsquo;études, nous pourrions désormais réaliser ce type de mécanisme dans son intégralité\n","date":"2020-06-01T15:42:32+02:00","permalink":"https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/projet-de-cao-mod%C3%A9lisation-dun-cold-python/","title":"Projet De CAO - Modélisation D'un Cold Python"},{"content":"How to Optimise Red Dead Dedemption 2 on PC Hi everyone, as i just gathered informations about how to optimize my RDR2 experience (as i\u0026rsquo;m playing with a little gaming laptop with a GTX 1060 3go and an old i5 6300HQ) i\u0026rsquo;m going to give you every useful links to optimize your game.\nAdd this to your launch settings: -processPriorityClass HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS\nImpact off every settings: https://www.game-debate.com/news/27927/red-dead-redemption-2-most-important-graphics-options-every-setting-benchmarked\nFor lazy: https://imgur.com/a/vZa3D3G\nThe settings optimum settings: https://www.naguide.com/red-dead-redemption-2-best-optimized-settings/\nThe one i use with my laptop: https://i.imgur.com/xXbzzWo.png\nSome recommanded settings from a video: https://imgur.com/gallery/1iAIITa\nBasic Xbox One settings: https://i.imgur.com/8XhWQK3.jpg\nHope i\u0026rsquo;m helping some, merry chirstmas and happy new year everyone !\nPS: I\u0026rsquo;m only gathering informations.
