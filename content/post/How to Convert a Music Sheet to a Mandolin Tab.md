# How to Convert a Music Sheet to a Mandolin Tab

Hey there ! Learning the Mando, wanted to start easy with tabs, but couldn't find any for the song I wanted, so I created it. And now that I know how to do it, you might learn how to do it as well.

**I decline all responsibility if you end up using tools for downloading content your don't own. The purpose of this guide is to help you import and convert a music sheet that you currently have, even thought I discuss briefly how to get some.**

Well, so I got a Mandolin and decided that Maiden Voyage OST from Sea Of Thieves was a good starter. Found a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/mandolin/comments/gi1fir/cover_of_maiden_voyage_from_sea_of_thieves_just/) with some [tabs](https://imgur.com/gallery/YNsMr3f), but I found it lacked some notes. My opinion is worth nothing anyway, but I ended up on this [score](https://musescore.com/user/30302993/scores/5698800) on MuseScore.

But hey, MuseScore is paid now for downloading scores, and it is using a Baryton, not a mando ! Well, no worries, I got everything worked out.

First, [download MuseScore without Muse Hub](https://musescore.org/en/download). Install it. *Edit : You need to download version 3.2.3 in a `.msi` file on Windows. That is, if you need Android to work properly, as of 2023-09-07, only scores created on 3.2.3 are readable on Android. More informations [here](https://musescore.com/groups/musescore-on-android/discuss/5169686).*

Then, it isn't the scope of this guide, but you will need to gather a music sheet of the song you want to learn. This can be found on the internet, on MuseScore or you might need to use [libre-score](https://github.com/LibreScore/dl-librescore). Either way, you end up with a `midi` or `pdf` file and you'll use it on MuseScore app that you previously installed.

Either import the PDF or open the midi file. This is done using the `File` menu, top left.

Then, delete the instruments that you don't need in the instrument tab on the left panel.

Add an instrument, a mandolin. You might need to search for it as it is not found under a category. You can also enter the instrument panel using `i` shortcut.

Now click on the triangle on the left of the `Mandolin`, that'll open the staves. Right click the default one and select `Create Linked Stave`. Then use the gear box of the newly created stave, and use `Tab 4 str full`.

You now should have a line with the music sheet you imported using the instrument it had, a music sheet for the mandolin and one for the mandolin tabs.

How to [copy them to your mandolin stave](https://musescore.org/en/node/331575) ? You'll click on the beginning of your former instrument stave, then use `CTRL+SHIFT+END` to select all the notes of that instrument, adn copy them using `CTRL+V`. Then you can paste it on your mandolin music sheet by clicking on the first case and using `CTRL+V`.

It will automatically convert to a mandolin tab. But [the notes might not have the right key/pitch](https://musescore.org/en/node/335758). If you still have all the mandolin notes selected, simply use the `UP` or `DOWN` key to adjust to the wanted key. Honestly, I don't know what would be standard for a Mandolin, feel free to help me out and I'll make a correction. I used my ear and found the good one.

You can finally save your sheet and use it on MuseScore. Tadaaa !
