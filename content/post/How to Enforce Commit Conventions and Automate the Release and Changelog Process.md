# How to Enforce Commit Conventions and Automate the Release and Changelog Process

## What is What ?

- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) is a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented.
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is a specification for adding human and machine readable meaning to commit messages. That's the one we'll use in every configuration here, it is close to the Angular specifications but has a few more types I reckon.

Common types according to [commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum) can be:

- build
- chore
- ci
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

## Tools We'll Use

- [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to automate the release process and changelog based on the Semantic Versioning rules.
- [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to add a prompt when commiting changes that will use conventional commits specifications.
- [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) to check and enforce that commit messages meet the conventional commit format
- [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master) is also used for presets.
- [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits) for conventional commits modal.

## Requirements

- [Install Nvm, Npm, Yarn - Setting up Node]({{< ref "Install Nvm, Npm, Yarn - Setting up Node" >}})
- A git repository

## Configuration

### Semantic Release

Go inside your git repository. Install the package locally using the following command :

```bash
npm install --save-dev semantic-release
npm install @semantic-release/commit-analyzer -D
npm install @semantic-release/release-notes-generator -D
npm install @semantic-release/github -D
npm install conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits -D
```

Note : It can also be installed globally, but it's not our goal as we just want to automate the release process of our repository here.

It should create a `package.json` and `package.lock` file in your repository. Don't forget to add `node_modules/` to your `.gitignore` file.

Then, create a configuration file named `.releaserc` at the root of your repository. More on that [here](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration), but just copy and paste that for now :

```text
{
  "branches": ["main"],
  "debug": true,
  "ci": true,
  "dryRun": false,
  "plugins":
    [
      "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
      {
        "preset": "conventionalcommits",
      }
    ],
    [
      "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
      {
        "preset": "conventionalcommits",
      }
    ]
}
```

### Commitizen

Install globally using :

```bash
npm install -g commitizen
```

Simply use `git cz` or just `cz` instead of `git commit` when committing. You can also use `git-cz`, which is an alias for `cz`. If you use npm 5.2+, you can also use `npx cz`.

### Commitlint

At the root of your project, execute the following commands :

```bash
# Install commitlint cli and conventional config
npm install --save-dev @commitlint/{config-conventional,cli}

# Configure commitlint to use conventional config
echo "module.exports = {extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']}" > commitlint.config.js

# Install Husky v6
npm install husky --save-dev

# Activate hooks
npx husky install

# Add hook
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg  'npx --no -- commitlint --edit ${1}'
```

### VS Code Extension

It [exists](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits). Simply install and use.
