I believe in a world where every software has an open-source alternative maintained by a group of great people to improve everyone's life, and not a company seeking only profits with high margins.

That's why I open-source almost all my projects and try to help as much as possible the people who need help using these projects. Of course, all of this takes time, time that I'm willing to spend so that you can use all of this for free.

However, if you use my projects and find them useful, if you want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, or if you believe in the same ideal as I do, it is possible for you to support me to keep the machine running.

Thanks a lot, and make sure to have fun in life o/
