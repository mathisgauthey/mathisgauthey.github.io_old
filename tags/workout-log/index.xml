&lt;p>This post is an extension of my &lt;a class="link" href="https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/my-complete-obsidian-workflow-to-manage-my-life/" >main post&lt;/a> showcase of my Obsidian workflow. You might want to check it out as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-gtd-">What is GTD ?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you already know all of that, skip this section.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting Things Done is a book written by David Allen. I recommend reading it, really. Like everything, reading key concepts online is good, but a whole book gives you a much better understanding of the underlying concepts described, why and how it works. I know it might sound like a lot of time, but it&amp;rsquo;s all worth it, trust me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But if you still don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or the willingness to read GTD, try at least to read &lt;a class="link" href="https://todoist.com/fr/productivity-methods/getting-things-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Todoist&amp;rsquo;s guide&lt;/a> or my personal interpretation below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="definitions">Definitions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A &lt;strong>task&lt;/strong> is a clear action step, something to be done. It must be precise and concrete.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &lt;strong>one-off task&lt;/strong> is a task that is enough by itself. Like &amp;ldquo;Calling the dentist to make an appointment&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Doing the dishes&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &lt;strong>project&lt;/strong> is a bunch of tasks to achieve a goal. It must have a due date, at least one that you tell yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>GTD is all about capturing every thoughts you have, clarifying them, organizing them, and acting on them. Your brain should be a factory for new ideas, not a warehouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you need an inbox, easily and quickly accessible everywhere to clear your head. We&amp;rsquo;ll use &lt;a class="link" href="https://todoist.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Todoist&lt;/a> and the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>obsidian-todoist-plugin&lt;/a> for that, but more on that latter. Every-time something (small or big) crosses your mind, you capture (step 1) it in here. It might be &amp;ldquo;clean the house&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;learn to play piano&amp;rdquo;, anything really.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you need to clarify (step 2) these items you&amp;rsquo;ve captured. For instance :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A task must be a clear and concrete action step (&amp;ldquo;laundry&amp;rdquo; ❌ → &amp;ldquo;Do the laundry at the laundrette&amp;rdquo; ✅).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A project must be a goal to achieve (use the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.mindtools.com/a4wo118/smart-goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SMART goal setting&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A reference material might be a note, a link, or a document to store that might help achieving some tasks. Or you might just need to store it for later unknown purpose. &lt;strong>Be careful not to fall in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>collector fallacy&lt;/a> trying to store and remember everything as if Wikipedia didn&amp;rsquo;t yet exist.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You then organise (step 3) them :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A task might be delegated or waiting for something, it might be the next action of a project, it might have to wait for a start date, be scheduled for a particular day, have a due date, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A project must have a due date, we need time constraint because it helps us see how much we have to do and not put too much on our plate. If there&amp;rsquo;s no due date, it goes into the someday maybe list of things you&amp;rsquo;d do one day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A reference material must be filled accordingly. If it&amp;rsquo;s a piece of information you can create a note, if it&amp;rsquo;s a document you might use your cloud storage, if it&amp;rsquo;s a link you might save it using Omnivore.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Tasks in obsidian-tasks vault have &lt;a class="link" href="https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Scripting/Task&amp;#43;Properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>different properties&lt;/a>, and are displayed by &lt;a class="link" href="https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Advanced/Urgency" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>urgency&lt;/a> using the default sorting. In short, you have to worry about these one using my template :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Filters#Happens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Happens date&lt;/a> :
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A due date : Date by which the task needs to be completed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A scheduled date : Date on which you plan to work on your task&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A start date : Date by which you can start working on a specific task. Possibly because you can&amp;rsquo;t do that task before this date.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Context tag : A &lt;code>tag&lt;/code> describing in which context you can do this task. This can be something like &amp;ldquo;phone&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;online&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;errands&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;mail&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;transports&amp;rdquo;, etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Time available : Not used actively in this vault but might take the form of a &lt;code>tags&lt;/code> as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Energy available : Used in this vault but in the form of a &lt;code>tags&lt;/code> just like contexts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Priority : &lt;a class="link" href="https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting&amp;#43;Started/Priority" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Task property from obsidian-task plugin&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You must review (step 4) your system periodically. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m using daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly notes. But more on that later as well, just remember that this is a &lt;strong>really important&lt;/strong> part of the process and helps maintaining it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, you need to engage (step 5) → It&amp;rsquo;s about time to get things done don&amp;rsquo;t you think ? That&amp;rsquo;s the fifth part.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="horizons-of-focus">Horizons of Focus&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In GTD, there&amp;rsquo;s multiple &lt;a class="link" href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2011/01/the-6-horizons-of-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>horizons of focus&lt;/a> :&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Tasks : Actions to take&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Projects : A bigger task with two or more sub-tasks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Areas of focus/responsibility : Areas of your life with a standard to maintain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Goals &amp;amp; Objectives : Short term goals for this or next year (1-2 years)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visions : How and where do you see yourself in a few years (3-5 years)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purpose and principles : Who you are, what is your purpose and on what principles do you live&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I learned that having goals alongside projects didn&amp;rsquo;t work for me as I would put goals somewhere but never act on it. That&amp;rsquo;s why on this system inside obsidian, projects &lt;strong>are&lt;/strong> goals, they live inside &lt;code>areas&lt;/code> of my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I have a goal to become an artist, I might have a daily recurring task inside that would be &amp;ldquo;Draw for 15min each day&amp;rdquo;. Or if I want to have a nice party next weekend as a goal, I might need to contact friends, prepare my shopping list, take friday off, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can&amp;rsquo;t just put on simple goals on a list and hope that your actions will go toward them. It won&amp;rsquo;t. But if you create a goal inside one of your &lt;code>areas&lt;/code> file, that links to a project note where you can put next actions and notes, you&amp;rsquo;ll move forward and clear that goal before the estimated due date !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in our case with this Obsidian setup :&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Tasks : They can be created simply by using markdown tasks formatting anywhere on your vault except the _Sources folder, the -Workout-Log folder, the 4-Archives folder, the 5-Templates folder and the Media Backlog note. The &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>obsidian-tasks&lt;/a> is configured to exclude these folders by design choice.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Projects : They live inside the &lt;code>1-Projects&lt;/code> folder. One note by goals or objectives, and inside the note you can put the tasks alongside notes and embedded attachments, just like you would with a piece of paper.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Areas : Areas contains projects. That&amp;rsquo;s where you&amp;rsquo;re creating your projects in the form of &lt;strong>obsidian tasks&lt;/strong>. You can use wikilinks to create the project note while doing so. You can also have some recurring tasks to maintain the area standard. And finally there&amp;rsquo;s an archive to clear the clutter using &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/ivan-lednev/obsidian-task-archiver" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>obsidian-tasks-archiver&lt;/a> plugin.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Visions, purpose and principles : They are less actionable and don&amp;rsquo;t require constant consideration. Just update the note every once in a while when you feel like your long term goals have changed after a big event in your life. Don&amp;rsquo;t change them often, focus on achieving tasks to progress in your goals instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-this-vault-template-for-life-management">How to Use This Vault Template for Life Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="inbox">Inbox&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Alright, so if we want to have a GTD setup, first we need an Inbox. And those of you who already had an obsidian vault with some plugins might have spotted an important issue : Obsidian is slow to launch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, fortunately there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/jamiebrynes7/obsidian-todoist-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Todoist&lt;/a> plugin for obsidian that gather tasks from your Todoist account. You can now quickly jot notes and tasks on your phone and computer directly inside Todoist&amp;rsquo;s inbox using shortcuts and see them inside the &lt;code>0-Inbox&lt;/code> file inside the &lt;code>0-Inbox&lt;/code> folder, or inside your daily-notes !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/images/2023-07-31_19-37-08_inbox_example.png"
loading="lazy"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-using-a-daily-and-periodic-notes-instead-of-a-beautiful-and-perfect-dashboard-">Why Using a Daily and Periodic Notes Instead of a Beautiful and Perfect Dashboard ?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I used Notion, Notion users love clean dashboard. Obsidian folks love them too. Why I hate them ? I&amp;rsquo;m a perfectionist with many OCD&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> issues. If I&amp;rsquo;m using a Dashboard, I&amp;rsquo;ll need to update it every time I feel like it (often), and &lt;strong>end up spending more time fine tuning a board and maintaining it than acting on my life&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using Daily and Periodic Notes allows you to use template, modify these templates if needed but without needing backward modifications everywhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Embrace the fact that you can change along your life journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It also provides an easy way to zoom in or zoom out to get the big picture. For instance, during a stressed period one might only rely on the daily notes and the current most important project. And as things calm down, you might consider seeing weekly, then monthly, eventually quarterly and finally yearly notes for projects plans and move their due date before to work on them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spoke about reviewing your system periodically before. I used to have some &amp;ldquo;periodic&amp;rdquo; checklist to do every periods. I ended that as it became a habit to sort pictures daily, budget weekly, clean files monthly, backup quarterly and yearly. But you might also use these notes template with tasks to do at the beginning or end of each period. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t, having periodic notes &amp;ldquo;forces&amp;rdquo; you to review where you are by zooming in and out of your day to day activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You also get a cool archive of tasks and projects achieved, and that&amp;rsquo;s great !&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-daily-note">The Daily Note&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The daily note is the note you&amp;rsquo;ll open each morning when you wake up and each evening when you finish your working day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first part looks like this :&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/images/2023-08-03_18-22-39_daily_note_first_part_example.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="2023-08-03_18-22-39_daily_note_first_part_example.png"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The name of the note is the current date in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ISO_8601" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ISO 8601 format&lt;/a>. You also get the weekday, and some navigation to the periodic notes where the day belongs to and to the previous and next day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You also have some shortcut to you &lt;code>Dashboard 🗺️&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Taskboard ✅&lt;/code> files, they helps you not to miss a project or a task respectively inside your vault. More on that later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then there&amp;rsquo;s some introductions callouts :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ongoing medias from your Media Backlog → Dataview script that show the medias inside columns containing the word &lt;code>Doing&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Time left in each periods → Using a &lt;code>dataviewjs&lt;/code> function based on the one provided to me by &lt;strong>Dovos&lt;/strong> from the &lt;code>Dataview discord&lt;/code> following an &lt;a class="link" href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/day-week-month-quarter-year-progress-bar-in-dataview/56853/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>obsidian post&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Google calendar weekly view → Using &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/YukiGasai/obsidian-google-calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>obsidian-google-calendar&lt;/a> plugin to show a weekly view of your google calendar.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tasks Calendar using &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/702573n/Obsidian-Tasks-Calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>obsidian-tasks-calendar&lt;/a> plugin based on &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>obsidian-tasks&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>obsidian-dataview&lt;/a> plugins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ongoing and upcoming projects from your areas files inside &lt;code>2-Areas&lt;/code> folder.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s also a notes space where you can create some &lt;a class="link" href="https://todoist.com/fr/productivity-methods/getting-things-done#taches-ponctuelles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>one-off tasks&lt;/a> while clarifying the Todoist inbox that sits just below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second part is all about tasks :&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/images/2023-07-31_19-46-22_daily_note_second_part_example.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="2023-07-31_19-46-22_daily_note_second_part_example.png"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s just a simple set of callout containing tasks queries :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Overdue tasks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tasks due today&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Upcoming tasks in the next 30 days&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Next actions grouped by context tags&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Waiting for tasks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Delegated tasks&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You finally get to the journaling part :&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/images/2023-07-31_19-58-02_daily_note_journal_part_example.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="2023-07-31_19-58-02_daily_note_journal_part_example.png"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This part contains :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A task log for tasks done today&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your workout log scanning for daily workouts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your recurring tasks&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And finally : Your journal ! Evaluate your mood (1-5), give a title to your day, write down your thoughts, be grateful, and write down the good things you brought to this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-periodic-notes">The Periodic Notes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Basically a periodic note look like this :&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/images/2023-08-02_18-59-34_periodic_note_example.png"
loading="lazy"
alt="2023-08-02_18-59-34_periodic_note_example.png"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will get for each periodic view some slightly different templates :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The time left callout&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A google calendar weekly view if on a weekly note, or schedule view if on a monthly note&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A task calendar with a weekly or monthly view depending on the note type&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Your projects happening during this time period&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The projects you achieved during this time period&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A task log (only if on a weekly note)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A journal entry&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="how-not-to-miss-a-task-or-project-inside-my-vault-">How Not to Miss a Task or Project Inside My Vault ?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>TaskBoard ✅&lt;/code> and &lt;code>Dashboard 🗺️&lt;/code> files will find any unplanned task or project inside your vault, as long as they are not inside any of the excluded files and folders :&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="the-someday-maybe-note">The Someday Maybe Note&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>Someday Maybe 💭&lt;/code> file is where you put your future goals and objectives in the form of a simple bullet list. Nothing fancy, we don&amp;rsquo;t care it&amp;rsquo;s not important as of now. But you might want to put things you want to do here, wait for a bit and decide if they&amp;rsquo;re still relevant after a while. If yes, simply create a project and start working on it !&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-writing-this-guide-">Why Writing This Guide ?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As I promised to quite a few people on different places, I&amp;rsquo;m releasing a full blown guide of my Obsidian workflow. It has many cool features that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people struggling with online :&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Tasks and project management with journaling, workout logging and media tracking. Using daily and periodic notes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Read-it-later with automated conversion to markdown and import inside your vault. Meaning all your past knowledge is inside Obsidian, available with a simple search alongside your notes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fast and simple one click upload obsidian publish alternative.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>But there&amp;rsquo;s plenty more. It took me some time here and there during the past year to come up with this setup. And don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it is &lt;strong>easy to use&lt;/strong> despite its awfully long name. But I&amp;rsquo;ll describe it with as much depth as I can for people who wants to fine tune it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously, it is merely just a starting point, with Obsidian you can (and you always should) do something that works well for &lt;strong>you&lt;/strong>. And that means creating your &lt;strong>own&lt;/strong> setup. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t forbid you from using this one as a starting-point.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-is-it-the-perfect-obsidian-setup-at-least-for-me-">Why is it the Perfect Obsidian Setup (at Least for me) ?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It embraces many relevant and high level productivity concepts alongside &lt;a class="link" href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Obsidian&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="https://help.obsidian.md/Getting&amp;#43;started/Link&amp;#43;notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>I will briefly explain each functionality here as well, and with more details in other posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="wait--dont-go-further-">Wait ! Don&amp;rsquo;t Go Further !&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I forgot something in the initial post. Here&amp;rsquo;s an update. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of quality of live improvements in this vault, here&amp;rsquo;s a few examples :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you hit &lt;code>ctrl+S&lt;/code> or just save the file, Obsidian will &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>lint&lt;/a> the file ! Meaning the whole writing, the frontmatter, the titles, the spacings, even the characters used for bold or italics will be standardized. In a way that works with my other plugins !&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you paste a link, the link will &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>auto-fetch&lt;/a> a title for markdown link !&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you paste an image, it&amp;rsquo;ll &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/reorx/obsidian-paste-image-rename" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>automatically&lt;/a> prompt you for an image title after a timestamp. That way, if you use clear unused image, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see if you deleted unwanted images or not.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The first header will &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/dvcrn/obsidian-filename-heading-sync" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>automatically&lt;/a> mimic the note title. And if you lint the file, the title metadata will change according to the title as well.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There&amp;rsquo;s also improvements in the way footnotes are managed along with a configurable shortcut to create footnotes automatically numbered. I recommend setting &lt;code>ctrl + shift + ^&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-tasks-and-projects-">How Do I Use the Tasks and Projects ?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll explain here how to use it. But if you want to understand why I built it this way, I encourage you to read my explanations &lt;a class="link" href="https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/why-using-obsidian-for-life-management/" >here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically you can create tasks everywhere except inside the following files and folders :&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">2
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">3
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">4
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">5
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">path does not include Archives
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">path does not include Templates
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">path does not include Workout_Log
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">path does not include Media Backlog
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">path does not include _Sources
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a predefined space inside your &lt;code>daily note&lt;/code> to add some &lt;code>one-off tasks&lt;/code>, it is below the &lt;code>Notes 📝&lt;/code> header. But you can use tasks alongside your notes anywhere else as long as it isn&amp;rsquo;t in one of the previously mentioned files or folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The workflow also involves using &lt;code>projects&lt;/code> to achieve goals &amp;amp; objectives. Each goal or objective then must have a &lt;code>project&lt;/code> with an according &lt;a class="link" href="https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Queries/Filters#Happens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>happens date&lt;/a> for viewing purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But where do I create such projects to achieves my goals &amp;amp; objectives? Inside an &lt;code>Area&lt;/code> file (eg: Finances) under your &lt;code>2-Areas&lt;/code> folder. Areas are to be understood as areas of focus (GTD) or areas or responsibility (P.A.R.A), meaning areas of your life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each &lt;code>Areas&lt;/code> file template has a &lt;code>Projects 🎯&lt;/code> header. Markdown tasks inside the file are considered as &lt;code>Project&lt;/code>, you can give it any task property you find useful but a deadline is important to use the setup properly. The task description can then be enclosed by &lt;code>[[&lt;/code> in order to create a wikilink to a &lt;code>project note&lt;/code> inside the &lt;code>1-Projects&lt;/code> folder. You&amp;rsquo;ll find more informations about wikilinks in the obsidian &lt;a class="link" href="https://help.obsidian.md/Linking&amp;#43;notes&amp;#43;and&amp;#43;files/Internal&amp;#43;links" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you feel the need to use a recurring task like &amp;ldquo;Add recent transactions to my budget each week&amp;rdquo; inside your Finances area to maintain a standard, you might create a project called &amp;ldquo;Maintain a good budget&amp;rdquo;. Inside the project note, you can create a &lt;code>recurring task&lt;/code> and that&amp;rsquo;s it. I would always recommend setting a happens date as it will help you see if it became a &lt;a class="link" href="https://jamesclear.com/habits" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>habit&lt;/a> by then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But how to &lt;strong>display my current tasks&lt;/strong> ? That&amp;rsquo;s the job of the &lt;code>daily note&lt;/code>. It will display tasks according to their &lt;code>happens date&lt;/code>, and it will also display the tasks that has one of the three specific tags (that can&amp;rsquo;t be used at the same time by essence) : &lt;code>#next&lt;/code>, &lt;code>#waiting&lt;/code> and &lt;code>#delegated&lt;/code>. They are displayed differently and tasks using the &lt;code>#next&lt;/code> tag will be grouped by context, meaning by their other tag(s).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s also the &lt;code>TaskBoard ✅&lt;/code> note where you&amp;rsquo;ll find unplanned tasks (without &lt;code>happens date&lt;/code> or &lt;code>tags&lt;/code>) so that you can&amp;rsquo;t miss a thing ! You should open this note sometimes to make sure nothing is left unattended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to show which project you should be working on, you should rely on your periodic notes (weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly) to display the relative projects based on their first happen date. The &lt;code>Dashboard 🗺️&lt;/code> plays a similar role. There&amp;rsquo;s also a callout inside the &lt;code>daily note&lt;/code> that queries upcoming projects (with a happens date in the next 30 days) and the projects in progress (using &lt;code>- [/]&lt;/code> tasks status).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>Someday Maybe 💭&lt;/code> file is where you put your future goals and objectives in the form of a simple bullet list. Nothing fancy, we don&amp;rsquo;t care it&amp;rsquo;s not important as of now. But you might want to put things you want to do here, wait for a bit and decide if they&amp;rsquo;re still relevant after a while. If yes, simply create a project and start working on it !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The higher horizons of existence are covered in the &lt;code>Vision, Identity, Purpose &amp;amp; Principles ⚙️&lt;/code> note.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Visions : Where and how you see yourself in 3-5 years.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identity : Who you are.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Purpose : Your ultimate goal in life, why you&amp;rsquo;re in this world.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Principles : Values you act upon everyday.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-journal-">How Do I Use the Journal ?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can write your feelings inside your &lt;code>daily note&lt;/code> and each &lt;code>periodic notes&lt;/code>, that&amp;rsquo;s always the last header purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The daily note adds a grateful part in which you should describe the good things that happened each day, and the things you did that were good to the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s also a mood tracking property (mood:1-5) that ranges from 1=bad to 5=amazing. It could be used with the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/pyrochlore/obsidian-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>obsidian-tracker plugin&lt;/a> to create a mood chart, but I have no use for it yet myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created a &lt;code>Journal 📓&lt;/code> note with a script that queries every single journal entries from your daily notes. Basically, it finds any header containing the word &amp;ldquo;Journal&amp;rdquo;, take the content, and stop at the next header found or the end of the note. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for the last time you had &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo;, just &lt;code>ctrl+f&lt;/code> inside this note in &lt;code>read view&lt;/code> and you&amp;rsquo;ll find it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need to import your journal from Daylio like me, you might want to take a look at &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/DeutscheGabanna/Obsidian-Daylio-Parser" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>obsidian-daylio-parser repository&lt;/a> on Github, or my &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/mathisgauthey/Obsidian-Daylio-Parser" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>fork of it&lt;/a> that works well with my example vault.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-workout-log-">How Do I Use the Workout Log ?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you right click on the &lt;code>-Workout-Log&lt;/code> folder and select &lt;code>Create new note from template&lt;/code>, you can select your workout template. It will be correctly named with a &lt;code>YYYY-MM-DD_&lt;/code> timestamp and will then be found inside the &lt;code>Workout Log 💪&lt;/code> callout of your daily note. Nothing fancy, just enough for keeping count.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is important that the first header of your workout template keep the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>templater&lt;/a> code snippet. This is how the timestamp is added to the template file name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll find that I added goals to sections of my workout linked to goals in my &lt;code>Sport&lt;/code> area. You can do something like this, or not. Experiment with queries and filters from the &lt;a class="link" href="https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>dataview&lt;/a> plugin or the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>task&lt;/a> plugin, you can make very powerful things without much effort. You just need to read their doc !&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Take extra care where moving file from the &lt;code>5-Templates&lt;/code> folder to the archives or anywhere else. &lt;strong>You should remove the templater code from everywhere before doing so&lt;/strong>, otherwise it might end up in an infinite loop of template file creation because of &lt;code>filename-heading-sync&lt;/code> and &lt;code>templater&lt;/code> plugin working asynchronously.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-media-backlog-">How Do I Use the Media Backlog ?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Your Media Backlog 🎮 file is a simple Kanban board. It is self explicit, just keep in mind that the daily note&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>Ongoing Medias 🎮&lt;/code> callout will query some kanban cards. But only the one inside columns that contains &lt;code>Doing&lt;/code>. That&amp;rsquo;ll help you to know what you could be doing during your daily spare time today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s some predefined tags with emojis that you can find in the colorful-tag plugin settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you finished something, you can add a date on the kanban board by using the &lt;code>Add a date&lt;/code> command from right clicking the card.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might want to add the &lt;code>#ongoing&lt;/code> tag if there&amp;rsquo;s going to be a sequel and you want to get back to it later on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-the-read-it-later-and-bookmark-manager-">How Do I Use the The Read-it-later and Bookmark Manager ?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This part is pretty simple. You simply need to connect your Omnivore account, add some pages to your inbox. It will then be synced to Obsidian inside the &lt;code>_Sources&lt;/code> folder each time you use the &lt;code>Omnivore button&lt;/code> on Obsidian left side bar. It has been configured to import inside a different daily folder based on when you saved the link. The generated markdown file will contains the document notes from Omnivore, then your highlight and content notes, and finally the whole converted markdown page. Simple as that !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It allows you to simply search inside Obsidian if you want to find past knowledge you came across. That&amp;rsquo;s why I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wont describe too much functionalities here as the app and plugin are in active development. I&amp;rsquo;ll let you discover the magic with their &lt;a class="link" href="https://docs.omnivore.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-note-sharing-process-">How Do I Use The Note Sharing Process ?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The whole process is detailed in &lt;a class="link" href="https://mathisgauthey.github.io/mathisgauthey.github.io_old/obsidian-publish-alternative-how-to-one-click-upload-your-notes-on-your-own-website/" >another post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The note sharing process requires to create a &lt;a class="link" href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hugo&lt;/a> website first on Github Pages. Once it&amp;rsquo;s done, you can simply change the &lt;code>share&lt;/code> boolean to &lt;code>true&lt;/code> in the note frontmatter, then select the command &lt;code>Upload filename to DEFAULT&lt;/code> of the &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>obsidian-github-publisher&lt;/a> plugin from the note drop down menu. It will use some &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Regular_expression" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Hugo links formatting&lt;/a>, commit and push to the relevant repository on Github, make a pull request that&amp;rsquo;ll be automatically accepted (allowing for easy reversing changes), and then use some Github Actions to build your website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attachments are automatically sent as well as linked notes as long as they have the &lt;code>share&lt;/code> boolean set to &lt;code>true&lt;/code> as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The posts will be sent to the &lt;code>content/post&lt;/code> folder and the attachments to the &lt;code>content/images&lt;/code> folder.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This setup relies heavily on Obsidian wikilinks and tags for task and project management, but also for attachment cleaning. One should take the habit to use them.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>_Media&lt;/code> folder : Storing all attachments (images and pdf for example) in the same folder using the &lt;code>YYYY-MM-DD_filename.extension&lt;/code> pattern thanks to &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/reorx/obsidian-paste-image-rename" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>obsidian-paste-image-rename&lt;/a>. Beware, all the attachments must be linked inside a note, otherwise the use of plugins such as &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/Vinzent03/find-unlinked-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Clean unused images&lt;/a> might delete them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>_Sources&lt;/code> folder : Storing all the websites sources you saved automatically using &lt;a class="link" href="https://omnivore.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Omnivore&lt;/a> or manually using &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/deathau/markdownload" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;li>&lt;code>-Periodic-Notes&lt;/code> folder : Storing weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly notes for &lt;strong>project&lt;/strong> management and journaling.&lt;/li>
