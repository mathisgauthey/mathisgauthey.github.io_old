&lt;p>Hi everyone ! Two years ago I made a post to find an app to log my GTG reps. I used Daily Counter Pro until the app was removed recently from the play store. As you helped me, I thought it was normal that I help in return.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just found another one : Logreps (&lt;a class="link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.logreps.app&amp;amp;hl=fr&amp;amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.logreps.app&amp;amp;hl=fr&amp;amp;gl=US&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it is perfect for me as it also record theses reps in Google Fit as micro activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google Fit is my centralized app (Running and hiking with Strava, workouts with Strongapp), so this is the perfect solution for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope it helps, have a nice day ! And no before someone asks, I don&amp;rsquo;t know the dev nor am I related to this app, I just came across it by searching for an app that fits my needs, and I share it with you all.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
